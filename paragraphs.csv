2,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",,,EY,Introduction,"Ask most people how much they get paid, and, if they are willing to admit anything, they'll tell you what their salary is. Usually, there's more to income than that. The way the IRS sees it, “gross income means all income from whatever source derived.” That means not only is your salary subject to tax, but so are many of the fringe benefits provided by your employer that you might receive—everything from country club memberships and employer-provided discounts to a company car. This chapter spells out in greater detail items of compensation that are taxable. Some fringe benefits you receive from your employer are tax-free. For example, the cost of the first $50,000 of coverage in a group term life insurance plan will be tax-free if all employees in the plan are treated in the same way. But, if your employer, in a moment of detached and disinterested generosity, presents you with a Rolls Royce as a gift, you will probably have to pay taxes on it. This chapter prepares you—in a tax sense—for whatever lies ahead."
3,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",What's New,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Limit on elective deferrals. The maximum amount of elective deferrals under a salary reduction agreement that can be contributed to a qualified plan (such as a Section 401(k) or 403(b) plan) in 2016 is $18,000 ($24,000 if you were age 50 or older). For more information, see the TaxPlanner regarding elective deferrals in chapter 10, Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities."
4,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Reminder,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Foreign income. If you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien, you must report income from sources outside the United States (foreign income) on your tax return unless it is exempt by U.S. law. This is true whether you reside inside or outside the United States and whether or not you receive a Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, or Form 1099 from the foreign payer. This applies to earned income (such as wages and tips) as well as unearned income (such as interest, dividends, capital gains, pensions, rents, and royalties)."
5,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Reminder,,EY,Tax Breaks and Deductions You Can Use Checklist,"Withholding on wages. If you're getting a very large refund when you file your return, remember that you can claim withholding allowances based on your expected deductions for 2017. Claiming more allowances will increase the amount of your take-home pay. For more details, see Getting the Right Amount of Tax Withheld in chapter 4, Tax withholding and estimated tax. Health flexible spending arrangements (FSAs). If your employer provides you with an FSA (also known as a cafeteria plan), consider taking advantage of it. You can contribute part of your salary to the arrangement on a pre-tax basis (not subject to income, social security, or Medicare taxes). You can then pay for qualified health care expenses (including prescription medication and insurance co-payments) tax-free. FSA coverage and reimbursement are allowed for your children who are under age 27 as of the end of your tax year. For more details, see Cafeteria Plans in chapter 22, Medical and dental expenses. 401(k) and 403(b) plan contributions. You can reduce your taxable wages (and your tax bill) by contributing on a pre-tax basis to a 401(k) or 403(b) plan sponsored by your employer. In 2016, you can contribute up to $18,000 ($24,000 if you are 50 or older by the end of the year). For more details, see chapter 10, Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities. Disability income. If you become disabled, any benefits paid to you while you can't work are usually taxable income. But if an insurance company pays the benefits, and the premium payments were originally taxable to you, those benefits will not be taxable. Check to see how your employer treats those premium payments. For more details, see Disability Pensions in chapter 10, Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities. Health savings accounts (HSAs). If you are covered by a health plan with a high deductible amount (HDHP) and meet other certain requirements, you may want to consider establishing a health savings account (HSA). Contributions made by you would be a deduction from your adjusted gross income, and contributions by your employer are excluded from your income and are not subject to employment taxes. Similar to FSAs, HSA's coverage and reimbursement are now allowed for your children under age 27 as of the end of your tax year. For frequently asked questions related to HSAs, see Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans, and additional information included in this chapter."
6,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Reminder,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you reside outside the United States, you may be able to exclude part, or all, of your foreign source earned income. For details, see Publication 54, Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad."
7,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Reminder,,EY,TAXALERT,"Foreign earned income exclusion. If you qualify, you may elect to exclude a maximum of $101,300 in foreign earned income from your U.S. taxable income in 2016. The amount of the exclusion is indexed annually for inflation. For more information on the foreign earned income exclusion, see The Foreign Earned Income Exclusion in chapter 42, U.S. citizens working abroad: Tax treatment of foreign earned income."
8,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Reminder,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"This chapter discusses compensation received for services as an employee, such as wages, salaries, and fringe benefits. The following topics are included. §  Bonuses and awards. §  Special rules for certain employees. §  Sickness and injury benefits. The chapter explains what income is included in the employee's gross income and what is not included."
9,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Reminder,,EY,EXPLANATION,"One of the most important decisions you have to make in determining your correct taxable income is what payments to include. A taxable payment is not limited to cash. It may be property, stock, or other assets. Also, you must include in your gross income the fair market value of payments in kind. Example 1 Your employer provides you with a car that is used for both personal and business purposes. The value of the personal use of the car is included in earnings and it is taxable to you. Example 2 You assist a group of investors in purchasing a piece of real estate. In consideration of your services, the investors award you an unconditional percentage of ownership in the acquired asset. You have invested none of your personal funds. The fair market value of your ownership interest is considered as compensation taxable to you in the year the transfer is completed. Example 3 A farmer receives 50 bushels of wheat as a payment in kind. Unless specifically excluded under a government program, the farmer has income to the extent of the fair market value of the wheat."

13,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"This section discusses various types of employee compensation including fringe benefits, retirement plan contributions, stock options, and restricted property."
14,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,,EY,EXPLANATION,"All compensation for personal services, no matter what the form of payment, must be included in gross income. Such compensation is subject to taxes in the year received, unless the taxpayer reports income on the accrual basis. If you perform services and decide that payment for them should be made to another person, the monies remitted to the third party are taxable to you. The IRS and the courts have long held that “fruits” of a taxpayer's labor are attributable to the “tree” that grew them. Furthermore, you may not render services and then ask your employer to hold the funds in an attempt to artificially control when the wages will be included in your taxable income. Example You are due compensation for work you performed. You advise the payer to hold the money because you will not require the funds immediately. The payer credits the payment due to you on the company books. You do not request the money until after the close of the tax year in which the services were rendered. The IRS may hold that you were in constructive receipt of the funds before year's end. The compensation may have to be included in your income for the year in which the payment could have been received, even though you were not actually paid until later."
15,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"You will have a problem with the IRS if you ask your employer after you have performed the work to withhold funds in an attempt to artificially control when the wages will be included in your taxable income. If you make arrangements to defer receipt of income prior to commencing work, you may not have a problem as long as the arrangement meets the requirements of the law. However, if your employer requires you to take your bonus in a later year, then it is not taxable to you until the year in which you receive it."
16,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,,EY,EXAMPLE,"If you arrange to have your employer pay your year-end bonus over a 5-year period, the IRS will not claim that you were in constructive receipt of the entire bonus at the end of the first year if the deferral of your bonus is within the strict nonqualified deferred compensation rules. (These rules are complex. Your employer will likely provide you with guidelines if you are eligible to participate in such a plan. Also, consider consulting with your tax advisor.) You may even arrange to have your employer add interest to your deferred bonus. You must make these arrangements prior to performance of the work for which the bonus will be paid. Keep in mind these types of arrangements must meet a complicated set of requirements, which have been in place since 2004. (You should consider consulting your tax advisor for specific guidance.)"
17,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Form W-2. If you are an employee, you should receive Form W-2 from your employer showing the pay you received for your services. Include your pay on line 7 of Form 1040 or Form 1040A, or on line 1 of Form 1040EZ, even if you do not receive a Form W-2. In some instances your employer is not required to give you a Form W-2. Your employer is not required to give you a Form W-2 if you perform household work in your employer's home for less than $1,900 in cash wages during the calendar year and you have no federal income taxes withheld from your wages. Household work is work done in or around an employer's home. Some examples of workers who do household work are: §  Babysitters, §  Caretakers, §  House cleaning workers, §  Domestic workers, §  Drivers, §  Health aides, §  Housekeepers, §  Maids, §  Nannies, §  Private nurses, and §  Yard workers. See Schedule H (Form 1040), Household Employment Taxes, and its instructions, and Publication 926, Household Employer's Tax Guide, for more information. If you performed services, other than as an independent contractor, and your employer did not withhold social security and Medicare taxes from your pay, you must file Form 8919, Uncollected Social Security and Medicare Tax on Wages, with your Form 1040. See Form 8919 and its instructions for more information on how to calculate unreported wages and taxes and how to include them on your income tax return."
18,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,,EY,EXPLANATION,"For 2016, your employer is required to furnish your W-2 to you no later than February 1, 2017. If a Form W-2 is not received from your employer by the tax filing deadline, Form 4852, the substitute for W-2, should be attached to the return. If you leave your job prior to December 31, 2016, and are not expecting to return to it prior to the calendar year-end, you can request a copy of your W-2 in writing from your employer and they are required to provide a copy to you within 30 days of the request if the 30-day period ends before February 1, 2017."
19,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Childcare providers. If you provide childcare, either in the child's home or in your home or other place of business, the pay you receive must be included in your income. If you are not an employee, you are probably self-employed and must include payments for your services on Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business, or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040), Net Profit From Business. You generally are not an employee unless you are subject to the will and control of the person who employs you as to what you are to do and how you are to do it. Babysitting. If you are paid to babysit, even for relatives or neighborhood children, whether on a regular basis or only periodically, the rules for childcare providers apply to you."
20,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"This section discusses different types of employee compensation. Advance commissions and other earnings. If you receive advance commissions or other amounts for services to be performed in the future and you are a cash-method taxpayer, you must include these amounts in your income in the year you receive them. If you repay unearned commissions or other amounts in the same year you receive them, reduce the amount included in your income by the repayment. If you repay them in a later tax year, you can deduct the repayment as an itemized deduction on your Schedule A (Form 1040), or you may be able to take a credit for that year. See Repayments in chapter 12."
21,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,EY,EXPLANATION,"In some cases, an advance payment of a commission or salary may be considered a loan, thus permitting you to delay paying tax on that amount. If the loan is repaid, you will not have to recognize any taxable income. If the loan is forgiven, you will recognize the amount of the loan as compensation in the year in which it was forgiven. See Canceled Debts in chapter 12, Other income, for a complete discussion. Commissions and salaries are considered to be income when they are paid to you or when they are applied as a reduction to your loan account. The key question is: When may a payment be characterized as a loan? Generally, for a transaction to be considered a loan, a debtor-creditor relationship must exist from the beginning. In other words, the lending party expects and will eventually receive monetary repayment. Payment in return for a future obligation to render services is not a loan. Thus, an advance on your wages is not a loan. Whether a payment is or is not a loan is usually a question of fact, requiring a review of each case's unique circumstances. Example If you receive an advance of your January 2017 salary on December 31, 2016, you will have taxable income in 2017."
22,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,EY,TAXSAVER,"Generally, you should take advantage of your employer's 401(k) plan or 403(b) plan. Your contribution to the plan will not be included in your taxable wages. See chapter 10, Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities, for more information about these plans."
23,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,EY,TAXPLANNER,"You may wish to consider a loan from your employer's qualified pension or annuity plan rather than an advance on your next year's salary. Loans are not considered taxable income to the borrower under most circumstances. See chapter 10, Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities, for rules regarding loans from an employer's qualified pension or annuity plan."
24,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,EY,TAXALERT,"Owner-employees, such as S corporation shareholders, partners, and sole proprietors, are able to borrow from their pension plans without being subject to a penalty tax."
25,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Allowances and reimbursements. If you receive travel, transportation, or other business expense allowances or reimbursements from your employer, see Publication 463. If you are reimbursed for moving expenses, see Publication 521, Moving Expenses. Back pay awards. If you receive an amount in payment of a settlement or judgment for back pay, you must include the amount of the payment in your income. This includes payments made to you for damages, unpaid life insurance premiums, and unpaid health insurance premiums. They should be reported to you by your employer on Form W-2."
26,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,EY,EXPLANATION,"If you received an amount in settlement or judgment for back wages and liquidated damages (e.g., under Title VII as amended by the 1991 Civil Rights Act), see Court Awards and Damages in chapter 12, Other income. Generally, awards intended to replace lost wages are included in your taxable income."
27,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Prior to entering any settlement agreement, you should consult with a tax advisor to ensure that you negotiate the most tax-favorable terms."
28,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Bonuses and awards. If you receive a bonus or award (cash, goods, services) from your employer, you must include its value in your income. However, if your employer merely promises to pay you a bonus or award at some future time, it is not taxable until you receive it or it is made available to you. Employee achievement award. If you receive tangible personal property (other than cash, a gift certificate, or an equivalent item) as an award for length of service or safety achievement, you generally can exclude its value from your income. The amount you can exclude is limited to your employer's cost and cannot be more than $1,600 for qualified plan awards or $400 for nonqualified plan awards for all such awards you receive during the year. Your employer can tell you whether your award is a qualified plan award. Your employer must make the award as part of a meaningful presentation, under conditions and circumstances that do not create a significant likelihood of it being disguised pay. However, the exclusion does not apply to the following awards: §  A length-of-service award if you received it for less than 5 years of service or if you received another length-of-service award during the year or the previous 4 years. §  A safety achievement award if you are a manager, administrator, clerical employee, or other professional employee or if more than 10% of eligible employees previously received safety achievement awards during the year. Example. Ben Green received three employee achievement awards during the year: a nonqualified plan award of a watch valued at $250, two qualified plan awards of a stereo valued at $1,000 and a set of golf clubs valued at $500. Assuming that the requirements for qualified plan awards are otherwise satisfied, each award by itself would be excluded from income. However, because the $1,750 total value of the awards is more than $1,600, Ben must include $150 ($1,750 – $1,600) in his income. Differential wage payments. This is any payment made to you by an employer for any period during which you are, for a period of more than 30 days, an active duty member of the uniformed services and represents all or a portion of the wages you would have received from the employer during that period. These payments are treated as wages and are subject to income tax withholding, but not FICA or FUTA taxes. The payments are reported as wages on Form W-2. Government cost-of-living allowances. Most payments received by U.S. government civilian employees for working abroad are taxable. However, certain cost-of-living allowances are tax free. Publication 516, U.S. Government Civilian Employees Stationed Abroad, explains the tax treatment of allowances, differentials, and other special pay you receive for employment abroad."
29,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,EY,EXPLANATION,"Prior to January 1, 2010, government cost-of-living allowances paid to federal civilian employees stationed outside the continental U.S. (other than Alaska) were tax-exempt for those employees whose compensation was set by statute. After January 1, 2010, employees who received this type of compensation will receive a taxable payment based on the location of their work."
30,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Nonqualified deferred compensation plans. Your employer may report to you the total amount of deferrals for the year under a non-qualified deferred compensation plan on Form W-2, box 12, using code Y. This amount is not included in your income. However, if at any time during the tax year, the plan fails to meet certain requirements, or is not operated under those requirements, all amounts deferred under the plan for the tax year and all preceding tax years to the extent vested and not previously included in income are included in your income for the current year. This amount is included in your wages shown on Form W-2, box 1. It is also shown on Form W-2, box 12, using code Z."
31,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,EY,TAXALERT,"Under a change made by a 2008 tax act, nonqualified deferred compensation paid for services performed after 2008 by an offshore corporation or partnership situated in a low or no-tax jurisdiction (a so-called tax-indifferent corporation or partnership) is included in the income of the employee or service provider when there is no substantial risk of forfeiture. Substantial risk of forfeiture exists if a person's rights to compensation are conditioned on the future performance of substantial services. These rules are complex. See your tax advisor for more information if this may affect you."
32,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Note received for services. If your employer gives you a secured note as payment for your services, you must include the fair market value (usually the discount value) of the note in your income for the year you receive it. When you later receive payments on the note, a proportionate part of each payment is the recovery of the fair market value that you previously included in your income. Do not include that part again in your income. Include the rest of the payment in your income in the year of payment. If your employer gives you a nonnegotiable unsecured note as payment for your services, payments on the note that are credited toward the principal amount of the note are compensation income when you receive them. Severance pay. If you receive a severance payment when your employment with your employer ends or is terminated, you must include this amount in your income. Accrued leave payment. If you are a federal employee and receive a lump-sum payment for accrued annual leave when you retire or resign, this amount will be included as wages on your Form W-2. If you resign from one agency and are reemployed by another agency, you may have to repay part of your lump-sum annual leave payment to the second agency. You can reduce gross wages by the amount you repaid in the same tax year in which you received it. Attach to your tax return a copy of the receipt or statement given to you by the agency you repaid to explain the difference between the wages on the return and the wages on your Forms W-2. Outplacement services. If you choose to accept a reduced amount of severance pay so that you can receive outplacement services (such as training in résumé writing and interview techniques), you must include the unreduced amount of the severance pay in income. However, you can deduct the value of these outplacement services (up to the difference between the severance pay included in income and the amount actually received) as a miscellaneous deduction (subject to the 2%-of-adjusted-gross-income (AGI) limit) on Schedule A (Form 1040). Sick pay. Pay you receive from your employer while you are sick or injured is part of your salary or wages. In addition, you must include in your income sick pay benefits received from any of the following payers: §  A welfare fund. §  A state sickness or disability fund. §  An association of employers or employees. §  An insurance company, if your employer paid for the plan. However, if you paid the premiums on an accident or health insurance policy yourself, the benefits you receive under the policy are not taxable. For more information, see Publication 525. Social security and Medicare taxes paid by employer. If you and your employer have an agreement that your employer pays your social security and Medicare taxes without deducting them from your gross wages, you must report the amount of tax paid for you as taxable wages on your tax return. The payment also is treated as wages for figuring your social security and Medicare taxes and your social security and Medicare benefits. However, these payments are not treated as social security and Medicare wages if you are a household worker or a farm worker."
33,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,EY,EXPLANATION,"For 2016, social security tax is withheld from an employee's wages remains unchanged at the rate of 6.2% up to the 2016 social security wage limit of $118,500. The Medicare withholding rate remains unchanged at 1.45% for both the employer and employee. In addition, higher-paid employees are subject to a 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax on wages (including tips) received in excess of $200,000 ($125,000 for a married individual filing a separate return). Fringe benefits and other compensation not paid in cash are also subject to this 0.9% additional tax. For married couples filing jointly, the additional 0.9% tax applies to the couple's combined wages in excess of $250,000. There is no corresponding employer portion of the Additional Medicare Tax. Employers are required to withhold the 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax on both cash and noncash wages paid to an employee in excess of $200,000 regardless of the tax filing status (married or single) indicated on the Form W-4 the employee submitted to the employer and without regard to any other wages received from another employer. So, an employee may see this additional tax being withheld even though he or she may not even be liable for it because, for example, the employee's wages or other compensation together with that of his or her spouse (when filing a joint return) does not exceed the $250,000 liability threshold. In this case, however, any Additional Medicare Tax withheld can be credited against the total tax liability—including income taxes—shown on the couple's income tax return (Form 1040). Self-employment income. The social security tax rate applied to net earnings from self-employment is 12.4% up to the 2016 social security wage limit of $118,500. The Medicare tax rate applied to net earnings from self-employment is 2.9%. In addition, self-employment income is also subject to the 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax if net earnings, whether by itself or in combination with wages received, exceed $200,000 for a single taxpayer ($250,000 for married couples filing jointly; $125,000 for a married individual filing a separate return). For more information about self-employment tax, see chapter 39, Self-employment income: How to file Schedule C."
34,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Stock appreciation rights. Do not include a stock appreciation right granted by your employer in income until you exercise (use) the right. When you use the right, you are generally entitled to a cash payment equal to the fair market value of the corporation's stock on the date of use minus the fair market value on the date the right was granted. You include the cash payment in your income in the year you use the right."
35,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,EY,EXPLANATION,"Stock appreciation rights (SARs) are rights awarded to an employee by a corporation that enable the employee to benefit over a certain period of time from the appreciation in value of the employer's stock without the employee actually owning the stock. Example In January 2016, you were given 10 SARs when your company's stock was valued at $25 per share. You may exercise your SARs at any time during a 24-month period. In the first 6 months after the SARs are awarded, the company's stock rises to $50 per share. However, you do not exercise your SARs because you expect the stock to continue to appreciate in value. Even though you have an unrealized gain of $250 [($50 less $25) x 10 SARs], you do not include it in gross income because the SARs have not been exercised. Eighteen months after the SARs are issued, the company stock is selling for $85 per share. You exercise your SARs, and the company pays you $600 [($85 less $25) x 10 SARs]. The $600 gain must now be included in your gross income as compensation."
36,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Miscellaneous Compensation,EY,TAXALERT,"SARs that vest after 2004 must meet certain requirements in order to defer taxation until exercise: 1. The value of the stock used in the SAR can't be less than the value on the date the SAR was granted, and 2. The SAR's spread can't be further deferred. Similar rules apply to the grant of non-statutory options, discussed later."
37,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Fringe Benefits,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Fringe benefits received in connection with the performance of your services are included in your income as compensation unless you pay fair market value for them or they are specifically excluded by law. Abstaining from the performance of services (for example, under a covenant not to compete) is treated as the performance of services for purposes of these rules. Accounting period. You must use the same accounting period your employer uses to report your taxable noncash fringe benefits. Your employer has the option to report taxable noncash fringe benefits by using either of the following rules. §  The general rule: benefits are reported for a full calendar year (January 1–December 31). §  The special accounting period rule: benefits provided during the last 2 months of the calendar year (or any shorter period) are treated as paid during the following calendar year. For example, each year your employer reports the value of benefits provided during the last 2 months of the prior year and the first 10 months of the current year. Your employer does not have to use the same accounting period for each fringe benefit, but must use the same period for all employees who receive a particular benefit. You must use the same accounting period that you use to report the benefit to claim an employee business deduction (for use of a car, for example). Form W-2. Your employer must include all taxable fringe benefits in box 1 of Form W-2 as wages, tips, and other compensation and, if applicable, in boxes 3 and 5 as social security and Medicare wages. Although not required, your employer may include the total value of fringe benefits in box 14 (or on a separate statement). However, if your employer provided you with a vehicle and included 100% of its annual lease value in your income, the employer must separately report this value to you in box 14 (or on a separate statement)."

66,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Retirement Plan Contributions,EY,EXPLANATION,"Under a qualified plan, participating employees may defer taxation on an employer's contributions into their individual accounts or for their vested benefits in qualified plans until some future date of distribution. Additionally, the tax on the income the account generates may be deferred until the money is distributed to the employee. The same deferred taxation is allowed under a nonqualified plan as long as the employee's interest in the plan is simply an unfunded promise by the employer to pay the employee. Additionally, the plan needs to meet all the requirements under the 2004 tax law change. (Whether a plan is qualified or nonqualified depends on whether or not certain statutory requirements are satisfied.) See chapter 10, Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities, for suggestions about what to do when you receive distributions from qualified plans."
67,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Retirement Plan Contributions,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Elective deferrals. If you are covered by certain kinds of retirement plans, you can choose to have part of your compensation contributed by your employer to a retirement fund, rather than have it paid to you. The amount you set aside (called an elective deferral) is treated as an employer contribution to a qualified plan. An elective deferral, other than a designated Roth contribution (discussed later), is not included in wages subject to income tax at the time contributed. Rather it is subject to income tax when distributed from the plan. However, it is included in wages subject to social security and Medicare taxes at the time contributed. Elective deferrals include elective contributions to the following retirement plans. 1.    Cash or deferred arrangements (Section 401(k) plans). 2.    The Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees. 3.    Salary reduction simplified employee pension plans (SARSEP). 4.    Savings incentive match plans for employees (SIMPLE plans). 5.    Tax-sheltered annuity plans (Section 403(b) plans). 6.    Section 501(c)(18)(D) plans. 7.    Section 457 plans. Qualified automatic contribution arrangements. Under a qualified automatic contribution arrangement, your employer can treat you as having elected to have a part of your compensation contributed to a Section 401(k) plan. You are to receive written notice of your rights and obligations under the qualified automatic contribution arrangement. The notice must explain: §  Your rights to elect not to have elective contributions made, or to have contributions made at a different percentage, and §  How contributions made will be invested in the absence of any investment decision by you. You must be given a reasonable period of time after receipt of the notice and before the first elective contribution is made to make an election with respect to the contributions. Overall limit on deferrals. For 2016, in most cases, you should not have deferred more than a total of $18,000 of contributions to the plans listed in (1) through (3) and (5) above. The limit for SIMPLE plans is $12,500. The limit for Section 501(c)(18)(D) plans is the lesser of $ 7,000 or 25% of your compensation. The limit for Section 457 plans is the lesser of your includible compensation or $18,000. Amounts deferred under specific plan limits are part of the overall limit on deferrals."

If your employer's plan allows it, you are able to designate part or all of your 401(k) contributions as “Roth 401(k)” contributions. As with a Roth IRA, your contributions to a Roth 401(k) are nondeductible, but all of the income in the plan will be tax-free to you when distributed if you meet the same requirements that apply to Roth IRAs—5 years of participation and distribution after age 59½, death, disability, or for up to $10,000 for a first-time home purchase.

Deferral plans under Section 401(k) (including the Thrift Savings Plan), 403(b), or 457(b) also have the option to permit participants to roll their pre-tax account balances into a designated Roth account within the same plan. (Not all plans offer this rollover option, so you need to check with your employer.) Before 2013, plans that offered this rollover option could allow participants to convert their pre-tax accounts to Roth accounts, but only with respect to money they otherwise had a right to take out of the plan; usually because they either reached age 59½ or separated from service from an employer. After 2012, any amount in a non-Roth account is allowed to be converted to a Roth account in the same plan, whether or not the amount is otherwise eligible for distribution. Just like a conversion to a Roth IRA (discussed in chapter 17, Individual retirement arrangements (IRAs), the amount rolled over is includible in taxable income except to the extent it includes a return of after-tax contributions."

Your employer or plan administrator should apply the proper annual limit when figuring your plan contributions. However, you are responsible for monitoring the total you defer to ensure that the deferrals are not more than the overall limit. If you set aside more than the limit, the excess generally must be included in your income for that year, unless you have an excess deferral of a designated Roth contribution. See Publication 525 for a discussion of the tax treatment of excess deferrals. Catch-up contributions.

75,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Stock Options,EY,EXPLANATION,"A stock option gives you the right to buy a company's stock at a specified price within a designated time period. The price is generally equal to the stock's value on the day you get the option. Generally, stock options are awarded to you by your employer as an alternative method of compensation. The option itself is generally not taxed when it is granted to you. The amount of income and the year when it is included in your taxable income depend on the type of option granted. There are two basic types of stock options: nonqualified (nonstatutory) stock options and incentive stock options. Nonqualified stock options (NSOs or NQSOs). Nonqualified stock options do not have some of the favorable tax attributes that incentive stock options (ISOs) have (see Incentive stock options in the next section). A nonqualified stock option is not taxable to you at the time the option is granted, unless the option is traded through a public stock exchange. Rather, you are taxed when the option is exercised on the difference between the fixed option price (the exercise price) and the fair market value of the stock on the date you exercise your option. This amount is taxed at ordinary income rates. The basis of the stock received is generally its fair market value on the date you exercise the option. If the stock appreciates thereafter, that gain will be taxable as a capital gain when you sell it. To determine whether you will have long-term capital gain (held longer than one year) or short-term capital gain (held one year or less) on the sale, your holding period begins on the date you exercise the option. An advantage of the nonqualified stock option is that you do not have to invest any personal funds when the option is granted or while the option is outstanding. However, if you exercise the option, you will need funds to pay the option price and the income tax that will be due on the option spread, the difference between the fair market value on the exercise date and the exercise price. Incentive stock options (lSOs). Generally, incentive stock options let you take advantage of a specific provision of the Internal Revenue Code that gives favorable tax treatment to this type of stock option. Incentive stock options are not taxable to you at the time the option is granted, nor do you pay tax when the option is exercised. Furthermore, if you do not dispose of the stock within 2 years after the option is granted, and you hold the stock for over 12 months after you exercise the option, any gain will be taxed as a long-term capital gain. However, if you sell the stock within 1 year after the date you exercised the option, or 2 years from the date of grant, the option loses its preferential treatment and the difference between the exercise price and the value at date of exercise is taxed to you as ordinary income. The spread between the option price and the fair market value of the stock upon exercise of the incentive stock option may be taxed indirectly if you are subject to alternative minimum tax. For a discussion of the alternative minimum tax, see chapter 31, How to figure your tax. For a further discussion of stock options, see chapter 13, Basis of property."
76,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Stock Options,EY,TAXPLANNER,"The top income tax rate on net capital gains from sales of most types of assets held more than 1 year is 15% for taxpayers that are in the 25%, 28%, 33%, or 35% tax brackets. For higher income taxpayers who are otherwise in the 39.6% income tax bracket (i.e., taxable income over $415,050 for single filers, $441,000 for head of household, $466,950 married filing jointly, and $233,476 for married filing separately), the maximum income tax rate on net capital gains is 20%. Net capital gains received by taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets are not subject to federal income tax; i.e., they are taxed at a 0% rate. These net capital gains tax rates apply to both the regular tax and the alternative minimum tax. For more information on tax rates on net capital gains, see chapter 16, Reporting gains and losses."
77,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Stock Options,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Some employers allow you to use employer stock already owned to finance the exercise of stock options. This exercise method is called a stock swap and allows you to use the stock value without recognizing the gain that would result if you sold the stock and used the proceeds to exercise the stock options. Certain stock holding periods and other restrictions can apply, which should be stipulated in your employer's stock option plan."
78,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Stock Options,EY,TAXSAVER,"Employee stock purchase plans. Many companies have stock purchase plans that offer participating employees the opportunity to buy company stock at a discount. Employees usually contribute to the plan by authorizing payroll deductions, which are not excludable from gross income. As an employee, you do not have to pay any tax when the plan's trustee exercises the option and purchases company stock. The stock is credited to your account within the plan. At a future time, you may request to receive the stock purchased for your account. On distribution, if you immediately sell the stock, any gain will be taxed as ordinary income. The gain will generally be determined by the sale price less the amount you contributed to the plan to buy the stock. Your company should be able to provide you with all relevant information. However, if after exercising the option you hold it for 2 years from the grant date and over 1 year from the purchase date, any gain will typically be treated as a long-term capital gain (except for the original discount). If you have a capital loss carryover, the fact that the gain is characterized as a capital gain could result in a tax benefit for you."
79,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Restricted Property,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"In most cases, if you receive property for your services, you must include its fair market value in your income in the year you receive the property. However, if you receive stock or other property that has certain restrictions that affect its value, you do not include the value of the property in your income until it has substantially vested. (Although you can elect to include the value of the property in your income in the year it is transferred to you.) For more information, see Restricted Property in Publication 525."
80,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Restricted Property,EY,EXAMPLE,"Your employer offers to sell you a parcel of land worth $5,000 for a bargain price of $3,500. You would have to include the $1,500 that the company, in effect, gave you as income for the year. In turn, your cost basis for the property would be $5,000, not the $3,500 you actually paid for it. This example shows the importance of putting a reasonable value on the property you receive from your employer. The lower the value is, the less income you will currently report. However, your basis in the property will also be lower and you will realize a larger gain upon the subsequent sale of the property."
81,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Restricted Property,TaxCode,TAXCODE,Dividends received on restricted stock. Dividends you receive on restricted stock are treated as compensation and not as dividend income. Your employer should include these payments on your Form W-2.
82,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Restricted Property,EY,EXPLANATION,"Restricted stock is stock subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. A substantial risk of forfeiture occurs when your ownership of property is conditional on the performance of substantial services in the future. When you complete these services or when the property may be legally transferred by you, whichever is earlier, you must recognize as income the difference between the fair market value of the property on that date and the amount, if any, you paid for it."
83,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Restricted Property,EY,TAXSAVER,"If you expect the value of the property to appreciate, you may choose to recognize the income generated by the receipt of the property before any restrictions on your ownership are lifted. This is called an 83(b) election. 83(b) elections must be made within 30 days of when the property is transferred to you. See the instructions in IRS Publication 525. If the property increases in value from the time you have recognized its value as income to the time the risk of forfeiture is removed, the increase will not be taxed at that time. Instead, the tax on that appreciation will be deferred until the property is sold. You may make this choice even if you pay an amount for the property at least equal to its fair market value and therefore recognize zero taxable income currently. You must decide no later than 30 days after you receive the property if you are going to recognize the income while the property is still subject to restrictions. If you recognize the income and then are forced to forfeit the property, you may deduct as a loss the amount you originally paid for the property, but not the amount of income you recognized as a result of the election. If you believe that the chances you have of forfeiting the property are high, then you should avoid recognizing the income up front. Example 1 On December 5, 2016, your employer sold you a share of stock for $10 that had a fair market value of $110. The stock is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture until May 1, 2018. Because the stock might have to be forfeited, you do not have to include the $100 difference between your purchase price and the fair market value of the stock in your 2016 taxable income. Assume you did not recognize the income immediately. On May 1, 2018, the fair market value of a share of stock is $210. You must include $200 ($210 − $10) in your taxable income in 2018. Assuming you are in the 28% tax bracket, your tax is $56. However, if you chose to recognize the income on the stock immediately, you would include $100 ($110 – $10) in your taxable income for 2016 and would incur tax of $28 if you were in the 28% tax bracket. Having made that choice, you owe no more tax until you sell the stock, at which time you will owe tax on the excess of the selling price over your $110 tax basis for the stock. Example 2 Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that after you recognized the income from the property in your 2016 income, you had to forfeit your claim to the property in 2017. You may deduct only the $10 you paid for the stock as a capital loss. You do not get to claim a loss on the $100 of income you previously reported."
84,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Restricted Property,EY,TAXALERT,"Taxpayers wishing to make an 83(b) election had been required to submit a written election statement with the IRS within 30 days of receiving the property, send a copy of the election to their employer, and, finally, include a copy of the previously-filed election along with the income tax return they file with the IRS. In mid-July 2016, the IRS issued final regulations that eliminate the requirement that taxpayers submit a copy of a Section 83(b) election with their tax return for the year in which the property subject to the election was transferred. The other requirements for submitting 83(b) elections remain unchanged. These regulations apply to property transferred on or after January 1, 2016. For transfers of property on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2016, the preamble to the proposed regulations provides that taxpayers may rely on the guidance in the proposed regulations (which is identical to the guidance contained in these final regulations)."
85,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Employee Compensation,Restricted Property,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Stock you elected to include in income. Dividends you receive on restricted stock you elected to include in your income in the year transferred are treated the same as any other dividends. Report them on your return as dividends. For a discussion of dividends, see chapter 8. For information on how to treat dividends reported on both your Form W-2 and Form 1099-DIV, see Dividends received on restricted stock in Publication 525."
86,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Special Rules for Certain Employees,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"This section deals with special rules for people in certain types of employment: members of the clergy, members of religious orders, people working for foreign employers, military personnel, and volunteers."
87,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Special Rules for Certain Employees,Clergy,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Generally, if you are a member of the clergy, you must include in your income offerings and fees you receive for marriages, baptisms, funerals, masses, etc., in addition to your salary. If the offering is made to the religious institution, it is not taxable to you. If you are a member of a religious organization and you give your outside earnings to the religious organization, you still must include the earnings in your income. However, you may be entitled to a charitable contribution deduction for the amount paid to the organization. See chapter 25. Pension. A pension or retirement pay for a member of the clergy usually is treated as any other pension or annuity. It must be reported on lines 16a and 16b of Form 1040 or on lines 12a and 12b of Form 1040A. Housing. Special rules for housing apply to members of the clergy. Under these rules, you do not include in your income the rental value of a home (including utilities) or a designated housing allowance provided to you as part of your pay. However, the exclusion cannot be more than the lesser of the following amounts: 1) the amount actually used to provide or rent a home; 2) the fair market rental value of the home (including furnishings, utilities, garage, etc.); 3) the amount officially designated (in advance of payment) as a rental or housing allowance; or 4) an amount that represents reasonable pay for your services. If you pay for the utilities, you can exclude any allowance designated for utility cost, up to your actual cost. The home or allowance must be provided as compensation for your services as an ordained, licensed, or commissioned minister. However, you must include the rental value of the home or the housing allowance as earnings from self-employment on Schedule SE (Form 1040) if you are subject to the self-employment tax. For more information, see Publication 517, Social Security and Other Information for Members of the Clergy and Religious Workers."
88,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Special Rules for Certain Employees,Clergy,EY,EXPLANATION,"To qualify for the exclusions from gross income, you must be appropriately ordained, commissioned, or licensed as a minister or other member of the clergy and you must be employed by a religious organization to perform ministerial functions. You qualify as a member of the clergy if you have been appropriately ordained according to the customs of your faith. The exclusion also applies to retired ministers, but not their widows. Exception An ordained minister may not claim the exclusions from gross income when the crux of his or her ministry consists of preachings against communism for a nonreligious, tax-exempt organization. Such a message is not religious because anticommunism is not an adopted tenet of his or her faith. Sham churches. The IRS has been cracking down on individuals who declare themselves clergy of newly established churches, arrange to have all their income paid to the church, and then have the church pay their living expenses. The object of such individuals is to take advantage of a church's tax-exempt status and shield income from taxation. Individuals who set up sham churches may be subject to criminal sanctions."
89,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Special Rules for Certain Employees,Clergy,EY,EXPLANATION,"Designation requirement. The church or organization that employs you must officially designate the payment as a housing allowance before the payment is made. A definite amount must be designated; the amount of the housing allowance cannot be determined at a later date. If you are employed and paid by a local congregation, a resolution by a national church agency of your denomination does not effectively designate a housing allowance for you. The local congregation must officially designate the part of your salary that is to be a housing allowance. However, a resolution of a national church agency can designate your housing allowance if you are directly employed by the agency. If no part has been officially designated, you must include your total salary in your income. Homeownership. If you own your home or are buying it, you can exclude your housing allowance from your income if you spend it for the down payment on the home, for mortgage payments, or for interest, taxes, utilities, repairs, etc. However, you cannot exclude more than the fair rental value of the home plus the cost of utilities, even if a larger amount is designated as a housing allowance. The fair rental value of a home includes the fair rental value of the furnishings in it. You can deduct on Schedule A (Form 1040) the qualified mortgage interest and real estate taxes you pay on your home even if you use nontaxable housing allowance funds to make the payments. See chapter 23, Taxes you may deduct, and chapter 24, Interest expense. Teachers or administrators. If you are a minister employed as a teacher or administrator by a church school, college, or university, you are performing ministerial services for purposes of the housing exclusion. However, if you perform services as a teacher or administrator on the faculty of a nonchurch college, you cannot exclude from your income a housing allowance or the value of a home that is provided to you. If you serve as a minister of music or minister of education or serve in an administrative or other function of your religious organization, but are not authorized to perform substantially all of the religious duties of an ordained minister in your church (even if you are commissioned as a minister of the gospel), the housing exclusion does not apply to you. Theological students. The housing exclusion does not apply if you are a theological student serving a required internship as an assistant pastor, unless you are ordained, commissioned, or licensed as a minister. Traveling evangelists. If you are an ordained minister and are providing evangelistic services, you can exclude amounts received from out-of-town churches that are designated as a housing allowance, provided you actually use them to maintain your permanent home. Retired members of the clergy. The rental value of a home provided rent free by your church for your past services is not income if you are a retired minister. In addition, the amount of your housing allowance that you spend for utilities, maintenance, repairs, and similar expenses that are directly related to providing a home is not income to you. These amounts are also not included in net earnings from self-employment. The general convention of a national religious denomination can designate a housing allowance for retired ministers that can be excluded from income. This applies if the local congregations authorize the general convention to establish and maintain a unified pension system for all retired clergy members of the denomination for their past services to the local churches. A surviving spouse of a retired minister cannot exclude a housing allowance from income."
90,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Special Rules for Certain Employees,Members of Religious Orders,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you are a member of a religious order who has taken a vow of poverty, how you treat earnings that you renounce and turn over to the order depends on whether your services are performed for the order. Services performed for the order. If you are performing the services as an agent of the order in the exercise of duties required by the order, do not include in your income the amounts turned over to the order. If your order directs you to perform services for another agency of the supervising church or an associated institution, you are considered to be performing the services as an agent of the order. Any wages you earn as an agent of an order that you turn over to the order are not included in your income. Example. You are a member of a church order and have taken a vow of poverty. You renounce any claims to your earnings and turn over to the order any salaries or wages you earn. You are a registered nurse, so your order assigns you to work in a hospital that is an associated institution of the church. However, you remain under the general direction and control of the order. You are considered to be an agent of the order and any wages you earn at the hospital that you turn over to your order are not included in your income. Services performed outside the order. If you are directed to work outside the order, your services are not an exercise of duties required by the order unless they meet both of the following requirements: §  They are the kind of services that are ordinarily the duties of members of the order. §  They are part of the duties that you must exercise for, or on behalf of, the religious order as its agent. If you are an employee of a third party, the services you perform for the third party will not be considered directed or required of you by the order. Amounts you receive for these services are included in your income, even if you have taken a vow of poverty. Example. Mark Brown is a member of a religious order and has taken a vow of poverty. He renounces all claims to his earnings and turns over his earnings to the order. Mark is a schoolteacher. He was instructed by the superiors of the order to get a job with a private tax-exempt school. Mark became an employee of the school, and, at his request, the school made the salary payments directly to the order. Because Mark is an employee of the school, he is performing services for the school rather than as an agent of the order. The wages Mark earns working for the school are included in his income."
91,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Special Rules for Certain Employees,Foreign Employer,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Special rules apply if you work for a foreign employer. U.S. citizen. If you are a U.S. citizen who works in the United States for a foreign government, an international organization, a foreign embassy, or any foreign employer, you must include your salary in your income. Social security and Medicare taxes. You are exempt from social security and Medicare employee taxes if you are employed in the United States by an international organization or a foreign government. However, you must pay self-employment tax on your earnings from services performed in the United States, even though you are not self-employed. This rule also applies if you are an employee of a qualifying wholly owned instrumentality of a foreign government. Employees of international organizations or foreign governments. Your compensation for official services to an international organization is exempt from federal income tax if you are not a citizen of the United States or you are a citizen of the Philippines (whether or not you are a citizen of the United States). Your compensation for official services to a foreign government is exempt from federal income tax if all of the following are true. §  You are not a citizen of the United States or you are a citizen of the Philippines (whether or not you are a citizen of the United States). §  Your work is like the work done by employees of the United States in foreign countries. §  The foreign government gives an equal exemption to employees of the United States in its country.

If you receive a lump-sum disability severance payment and are later awarded VA disability benefits, exclude 100% of the severance benefit from your income. However, you must include in your income any lump-sum readjustment or other nondisability severance payment you received on release from active duty, even if you are later given a retroactive disability rating by the VA. Special period of limitation. In most cases, under the period of limitation, a claim for credit or refund must be filed within 3 years from the time a return was filed or 2 years from the time the tax was paid. However, if you receive a retroactive service-connected disability rating determination, the period of limitation is extended by a 1-year period beginning on the date of the determination. This 1-year extended period applies to claims for credit or refund filed after June 17, 2008, and does not apply to any tax year that began more than 5 years before the date of the determination. Example. You retired in 2010 and receive a pension based on your years of service. On August 3, 2016, you receive a determination of service-connected disability retroactive to 2010. Generally, you could claim a refund for the taxes paid on your pension for 2013, 2014, and 2015. However, under the special limitation period, you can also file a claim for 2012 as long as you file the claim by August 3, 2017. You cannot file a claim for 2010 and 2011 because those tax years began more than 5 years before the determination. Terrorist attack or military action. Do not include in your income disability payments you receive for injuries incurred as a direct result of a terrorist attack directed against the United States (or its allies), whether outside or within the United States or from military action. See Publication 3920, Tax Relief for Victims of Terrorist Attacks, for more information."

Amounts you receive from them (other than policyholder dividends or premium refunds) in most cases are excludable from income as amounts received for personal injury or sickness. To claim an exclusion for payments made on a per diem or other periodic basis under a long-term care insurance contract, you must file Form 8853 with your return. A long-term care insurance contract is an insurance contract that only provides coverage for qualified long-term care services. The contract must: §  Be guaranteed renewable, §  Not provide for a cash surrender value or other money that can be paid, assigned, pledged, or borrowed, §  Provide that refunds, other than refunds on the death of the insured or complete surrender or cancellation of the contract, and dividends under the contract may be used only to reduce future premiums or increase future benefits, and §  In most cases, not pay or reimburse expenses incurred for services or items that would be reimbursed under Medicare, except where Medicare is a secondary payer or the contract makes per diem or other periodic payments without regard to expenses. Qualified long-term care services. Qualified long-term care services are: §  Necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating, and rehabilitative services, and maintenance and personal care services, and §  Required by a chronically ill individual and provided pursuant to a plan of care as prescribed by a licensed health care practitioner.

A chronically ill individual is one who has been certified by a licensed health care practitioner within the previous 12 months as one of the following: §  An individual who, for at least 90 days, is unable to perform at least two activities of daily living without substantial assistance due to loss of functional capacity. Activities of daily living are eating, toileting, transferring, bathing, dressing, and continence. §  An individual who requires substantial supervision to be protected from threats to health and safety due to severe cognitive impairment.

108,Chapter 5,"Wages, salaries, and other earnings",Sickness and Injury Benefits,Other Sickness and Injury Benefits,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"In addition to disability pensions and annuities, you may receive other payments for sickness or injury. Railroad sick pay. Payments you receive as sick pay under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act are taxable and you must include them in your income. However, do not include them in your income if they are for an on-the-job injury. If you received income because of a disability, see Disability Pensions, earlier. Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA). Payments received under this Act for personal injury or sickness, including payments to beneficiaries in case of death, are not taxable. However, you are taxed on amounts you receive under this Act as continuation of pay for up to 45 days while a claim is being decided. Report this income as wages. Also, pay for sick leave while a claim is being processed is taxable and must be included in your income as wages. You can deduct the amount you spend to buy back sick leave for an earlier year to be eligible for nontaxable FECA benefits for that period. It is a miscellaneous deduction subject to the 2%-of-AGI limit on Schedule A (Form 1040). If you buy back sick leave in the same year you used it, the amount reduces your taxable sick leave pay. Do not deduct it separately. Other compensation. Many other amounts you receive as compensation for sickness or injury are not taxable. These include the following amounts. §  Compensatory damages you receive for physical injury or physical sickness, whether paid in a lump sum or in periodic payments. §  Benefits you receive under an accident or health insurance policy on which either you paid the premiums or your employer paid the premiums but you had to include them in your income. §  Disability benefits you receive for loss of income or earning capacity as a result of injuries under a no-fault car insurance policy. §  Compensation you receive for permanent loss or loss of use of a part or function of your body, or for your permanent disfigurement. This compensation must be based only on the injury and not on the period of your absence from work. These benefits are not taxable even if your employer pays for the accident and health plan that provides these benefits. Reimbursement for medical care. A reimbursement for medical care is generally not taxable. However, it may reduce your medical expense deduction. For more information, see chapter 22."

111,Chapter 6,Tip income,,,EY,Introduction,"Tips are one of the least-reported types of income and the IRS has been trying to do something about that. Since 2000, it has been undertaking a controversial audit program under which it conducts employer-only tip examinations and assessments for FICA in cases of “flagrant violations” of tip reporting rules. This audit program focuses on cases of serious noncompliance at businesses in which tipping is customary. As an alternative to audit examinations, the IRS also established voluntary compliance agreements for industries, such as the restaurant industry, where tipping is customary. These agreements are designed to enhance tax compliance among tipped employees through taxpayer education, instead of through traditional enforcement actions, such as tip examinations. Nevertheless, employee reporting requirements and employer withholding requirements have not changed. This chapter spells out the details of reporting tip income."
112,Chapter 6,Tip income,,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"This chapter is for employees who receive tips. All tips you receive are income and are subject to federal income tax. You must include in gross income all tips you receive directly, charged tips paid to you by your employer, and your share of any tips you receive under a tip-splitting or tip-pooling arrangement. The value of noncash tips, such as tickets, passes, or other items of value, is also income and subject to tax."
113,Chapter 6,Tip income,,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Self-employed individuals may receive cash tips or other income from clients. This additional income is not considered income from tips. It is, however, considered self-employment income and must be reported to the IRS on Schedule C. See chapter 39, Self-employment income: How to file Schedule C, for more information."
114,Chapter 6,Tip income,,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Reporting your tip income correctly is not difficult. You must do three things. 1.    Keep a daily tip record. 2.    Report tips to your employer. 3.    Report all your tips on your income tax return. This chapter will explain these three things and show you what to do on your tax return if you have not done the first two. This chapter will also show you how to treat allocated tips.

118,Chapter 6,Tip income,Keeping a Daily Tip Record,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Why keep a daily tip record. You must keep a daily tip record so you can: §  Report your tips accurately to your employer, §  Report your tips accurately on your tax return, and §  Prove your tip income if your return is ever questioned. How to keep a daily tip record. There are two ways to keep a daily tip record. You can either: §  Write information about your tips in a tip diary, or §  Keep copies of documents that show your tips, such as restaurant bills and credit or debit card charge slips. You should keep your daily tip record with your tax or other personal records. You must keep your records for as long as they are important for administration of the federal tax law. For information on how long to keep records, see How long to keep records in chapter 1. If you keep a tip diary, you can use Form 4070A, Employee's Daily Record of Tips. To get Form 4070A, ask your employer for Publication 1244 or go online to www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1244.pdf for a copy of Publication 1244. Publication 1244 includes a 1-year supply of Form 4070A. Each day, write in the information asked for on the form. In addition to the information asked for on Form 4070A, you also need to keep a record of the date and value of any noncash tips you get, such as tickets, passes, or other items of value. Although you do not report these tips to your employer, you must report them on your tax return."
119,Chapter 6,Tip income,Keeping a Daily Tip Record,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"You are not required to complete Form 4070A as long as you have an alternative method of recording your tips. The IRS issues the form merely to help employees keep track of their income from tips. Complete written records are essential, particularly if you must later substantiate a claim that you did not receive all the tips your employer alleges were allocated to you. Examples of documentary evidence are copies of restaurant bills, credit card charges, or charges under any other arrangement containing amounts added by the customer as a tip."
120,Chapter 6,Tip income,Keeping a Daily Tip Record,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you do not use Form 4070A, start your records by writing your name, your employer's name, and the name of the business (if it is different from your employer's name). Then, each workday, write the date and the following information. §  Cash tips you get directly from customers or from other employees. §  Tips from credit and debit card charge customers that your employer pays you. §  The value of any noncash tips you get, such as tickets, passes, or other items of value. §  The amount of tips you paid out to other employees through tip pools or tip splitting, or other arrangements, and the names of the employees to whom you paid the tips."
121,Chapter 6,Tip income,Keeping a Daily Tip Record,,EY,EXPLANATION,"An arbitrary fixed charge that your employer adds to the customer's bill is not a tip or gratuity subject to tip reporting and withholding requirements. Even if it is called a tip, the amount an employee is guaranteed from his or her employer is additional wage compensation. Example A club does not permit its members to tip its employees, but adds 10% to each member's restaurant charges. This additional amount is set aside in a fund and is disbursed monthly to all employees. Because the employer controls the allocation of the funds, they are additional wages, not tips. However, if a headwaiter receives one lump-sum payment to be distributed to all waiters and waitresses, then the payment is income from tips. The headwaiter would include in his income only the amount he retained, not the total he distributed."
122,Chapter 6,Tip income,Keeping a Daily Tip Record,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Electronic tip record. You can use an electronic system provided by your employer to record your daily tips. If you do, you must receive and keep a paper copy of this record. Service charges. Do not write in your tip diary the amount of any service charge that your employer adds to a customer's bill and then pays to you and treats as wages. This is part of your wages, not a tip. See examples below. Example 1. Good Food Restaurant adds an 18% charge to the bill for parties of 6 or more customers. Jane's bill for food and beverages for her party of 8 includes an amount on the tip line equal to 18% of the charges for food and beverages, and the total includes this amount. Because Jane did not have an unrestricted right to determine the amount on the “tip line,” the 18% charge is considered a service charge. Do not include the 18% charge in your tip diary. Service charges that are paid to you are considered wages, not tips. Example 2. Good Food Restaurant also includes sample calculations of tip amounts at the bottom of its bills for food and beverages provided to customers. David's bill includes a blank “tip line,” with sample tip calculations of 15%, 18%, and 20% of his charges for food and beverages at the bottom of the bill beneath the signature line. Because David is free to enter any amount on the “tip line” or leave it blank, any amount he includes is considered a tip. Be sure to include this amount in your tip diary."
123,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Why report tips to your employer. You must report tips to your employer so that: §  Your employer can withhold federal income tax and social security, Medicare, Additional Medicare, or railroad retirement taxes; §  Your employer can report the correct amount of your earnings to the Social Security Administration or Railroad Retirement Board (which affects your benefits when you retire or if you become disabled, or your family's benefits if you die); and §  You can avoid the penalty for not reporting tips to your employer (explained later)."
124,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,EY,TAXSAVER,"Your employer usually deducts the withholding due on tips from your regular wages. However, you do not have to have income tax withheld if you can claim exemption from withholding. You can claim an exemption only if you had no income tax liability last year and expect none this year. See Exemption from Withholding in chapter 4, Tax withholding and estimated tax, for more information. Example Many students and retired persons who expect to have no federal income tax liability work part-time in occupations in which they receive tips. To avoid unnecessary income tax withholding, you may file a Form W-4 with your employer, certifying that you had no federal income tax liability last year and expect to have none this year as well."
125,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"What tips to report. Report to your employer only cash, check, and debit and credit card tips you receive. If your total tips for any 1 month from any one job are less than $20, do not report the tips for that month to that employer. If you participate in a tip-splitting or tip-pooling arrangement, report only the tips you receive and retain. Do not report to your employer any portion of the tips you receive that you pass on to other employees. However, you must report tips you receive from other employees. Do not report the value of any noncash tips, such as tickets or passes, to your employer. You do not pay social security, Medicare, Additional Medicare or railroad retirement taxes on these tips."
126,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,EY,EXAMPLE,"If you earn only $15 in tips in October, you do not have to report anything to your employer. However, you must still pay federal income tax on the tips when you report them on your tax return. The $15 is never subject to social security and Medicare taxes."
127,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"If it is not customary to tip for a type of service, the IRS may be willing to concede that additional payments received for normal services may not be tips and may, indeed, be tax-free gifts from the customer. You would have to prove that the services performed did not extend beyond the minimum requirements of the job and that you work in an industry in which extra compensation is not traditional. This claim would be impossible to sustain in all but the most unusual circumstances. The IRS and the courts generally presume that amounts received for performing services are taxable as compensation."
128,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"How to report. If your employer does not give you any other way to report tips, you can use Form 4070. Fill in the information asked for on the form, sign and date the form, and give it to your employer. To get a 1-year supply of the form, ask your employer for Publication 1244 or go online to www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1244.pdf for a copy of Publication 1244. If you do not use Form 4070, give your employer a statement with the following information. §  Your name, address, and social security number. §  Your employer's name, address, and business name (if it is different from your employer's name). §  The month (or the dates of any shorter period) in which you received tips. §  The total tips required to be reported for that period. You must sign and date the statement. Be sure to keep a copy with your tax or other personal records. Your employer may require you to report your tips more than once a month. However, the statement cannot cover a period of more than 1 calendar month. Electronic tip statement. Your employer can have you furnish your tip statements electronically."
129,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"IRS regulations permit an employer to adopt a system under which some or all of the tipped employees of the employer would furnish their tip statements electronically. Alternatively, employees may provide the information on paper, or through use of Form 4070, Employee's Report of Tips to Employer. If the information is submitted electronically, the electronic system must ensure that the information received is the information transmitted by the employee. The entry by the employee in the electronic system on a daily (or more frequent) basis, together with the daily record based on these entries provided by the employer, will satisfy IRS substantiation requirements."
130,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"When to report. Give your report for each month to your employer by the 10th of the next month. If the 10th falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, give your employer the report by the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Example. You must report your tips received in May 2017 by June 12, 2017."
131,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,EY,EXPLANATION,"The amount of tips you report to your employer is treated as income subject to withholding in the month after it has been reported. Example If you earn $75 in tips in October, you must report that amount to your employer by November 10. In November your employer will treat the $75 in tips in November as additional compensation subject to federal income tax withholding and social security tax."
132,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,EY,TAXSAVER,"If you earn $25 from tips in December 2016, but do not report it to your employer until January 2017, you may defer recognizing that $25 of income until you file your 2017 tax return."
133,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Final report. If your employment ends during the month, you can report your tips when your employment ends. Penalty for not reporting tips. If you do not report tips to your employer as required, you may be subject to a penalty equal to 50% of the social security, Medicare, and Additional Medicare taxes or railroad retirement tax you owe on the unreported tips. For information about these taxes, see Reporting social security, Medicare, Additional Medicare, or railroad retirement taxes on tips not reported to your employer under Reporting Tips on Your Tax Return, later. The penalty amount is in addition to the taxes you owe. You can avoid this penalty if you can show reasonable cause for not reporting the tips to your employer. To do so, attach a statement to your return explaining why you did not report them."
134,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,EY,TAXALERT,"Since 1995, the IRS has had in place a voluntary program for tip reporting by food and beverage establishments, known as the Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment (TRAC). This program is intended to increase tip reporting and compliance levels by both employees and employers. Under TRAC, an employer agrees to (1) maintain quarterly educational programs that will instruct new employees and update existing employees as to their reporting obligations; (2) comply with all federal tax requirements regarding the maintaining of records, filing of returns, and depositing of taxes; and (3) set up procedures to ensure the accurate recording of all tips. In return, the IRS agrees to base the restaurant's liability for employment taxes solely on reported tips and any unreported tips discovered during an IRS audit of an employee. During 2000, the IRS announced that it was simplifying its voluntary income from tip compliance agreements and expanding them to all industries where tipping is customary. Under the Tip Rate Determination Agreement (TRDA), the IRS and the employer work together to determine the amount of tips that employees generally receive and should report. Unlike the TRAC, the TRDA does not have any specific education requirements. Previously, only the gaming, food and beverage, and cosmetology and barber industries were able to make TRDAs with the IRS. The IRS has now developed a TRDA and TRAC for other industries in which tipping is customary. Employers that can participate include taxicab and limousine companies, airport skycap companies, and car wash operations. In September 2004, the IRS announced that it would indefinitely extend its Tip Rate Determination and Education Program (TRD/EP). Originally, the TRD/EP program was due to expire in 2005, but due to its success it will continue indefinitely. The program offers employers several voluntary agreement options that assist both employers and employees to comply with tip reporting laws. These options include the TRDA, TRAC, and Employer-designed TRAC (EmTRAC). Each agreement educates employers and employees on federal tax laws regarding tips, simplifies the process for employees to calculate and report their tips and pay taxes, and reduces the likelihood and burden associated with a tip examination. The IRS has issued draft forms of TRAC agreements that can be used as a model for various industries. Employers considering entering into TRAC agreements with the IRS should carefully determine if such an agreement is in their best interest. Consult your tax advisors for moreinformation."
135,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Giving your employer money for taxes. Your regular pay may not be enough for your employer to withhold all the taxes you owe on your regular pay plus your reported tips. If this happens, you can give your employer money until the close of the calendar year to pay the rest of the taxes. If you do not give your employer enough money, your employer will apply your regular pay and any money you give in the following order. 1.    All taxes on your regular pay. 2.    Social security, Medicare, and Additional Medicare taxes or railroad retirement taxes on your reported tips. 3.    Federal, state, and local income taxes on your reported tips. Any taxes that remain unpaid can be collected by your employer from your next paycheck. If withholding taxes remain uncollected at the end of the year, you may be subject to a penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes. See Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax, for more information."
136,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,EY,TAXSAVER,"If your base wages are not enough to cover your necessary withholding taxes, it may be more beneficial to pay your employer money to cover the withholding deficiency at the end of the year instead of making payments to your employer throughout the year. Set aside sufficient cash from tips until the end of the tax year; then, give your employer enough cash to cover the remaining withholding taxes. This approach allows you access to the cash throughout the year and avoids underpayment penalties from not paying in enough taxes during the year. If you find it easier to manage your cash flow by paying the additional taxes due on a more frequent basis, you can make estimated tax payments or pay the taxes to your employer periodically throughout the year. See chapter 4, Tax withholding and estimated tax, for information on estimated tax."
137,Chapter 6,Tip income,Reporting Tips To Your Employer,,EY,TAXALERT,"Effective May 29, 2007, the IRS issued an updated Revenue Procedure addressing the Gaming Industry Tip Compliance Agreement Program (GITCA Program). This program is designed to promote compliance by gaming industry employers and employees with accurate tip income reporting and is intended to reduce disputes with the IRS. The usual duration of any such agreement is three years. Under the GITCA Program, a gaming industry employer and the IRS may work together to reach a Gaming Industry Tip Compliance Agreement (GITCA) that objectively establishes minimum tip rates for tipped employees in specified occupational categories, prescribes a threshold level of participation by the employer's employees, and reduces compliance burdens for the employer and enforcement burdens for the IRS. All employers operating a gaming establishment may participate in the GITCA Program. An employee can participate in this type of program only if his/her employer executes the IRS-prescribed GITCA. The employer's participation in this program is voluntary. If your employer decides to participate in this program, it should furnish you with a signed Model Gaming Employee Tip Reporting Agreement. This Agreement will outline the specific reporting requirements by the employee and employer. Further information about the GITCA Program is available in Revenue Procedure 2007-32."

158,Chapter 6,Tip income,Allocated Tips,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"The reporting requirements for employers are only guidelines and apply only to large food or beverage establishments. Nevertheless, the courts have imposed industry averages on taxpayers who had no records or inadequate records. Example In a series of cases, the courts held that average tips for taxi drivers come to 10% of gross income. A court was willing to accept a 2% figure for tips only when the driver produced daily logs that showed the amounts of fares and tips. The court believed that the records were true and accurate. The courts have held that the average tips for barbers and hairdressers range from 2% to 8%. To estimate the tip income of waiters and waitresses, the IRS has used various methods, based on the total sales of the restaurant. While the courts often adjust the IRS determination, they usually accept any reasonable method the IRS uses. Recent Federal Appeals case law has held that the IRS can assess the restaurant owners for FICA taxes without attempting to first determine the unreported income of each individual employee. Our advice is: Maintain adequate records of all amounts that you actually receive."
159,Chapter 6,Tip income,Allocated Tips,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"If the employee or employer would like to request a tip rate lower than 8%, he or she must file a petition with the district director for the IRS district in which the business is located.

The petition must state the total number of directly tipped employees and the number of employees consenting to the petition.

164,Chapter 7,Interest income,,,EY,Introduction,"Interest income is a significant portion of all income earned by many Americans. The government takes pains to make sure that all such income is reported by taxpayers. That's why payers of interest, like banks, are required to report to the government the amounts of interest they pay out and to whom. If you do not supply your proper tax identification number—usually your social security number—to a payer of interest, tax will automatically be withheld. Some investments permit you to defer reporting interest income. Such investments may boost the after-tax rate of return on your money, because you may pay tax on the income in a year—a retirement year, for example—when your tax rate is lower. This chapter outlines several tax planning ideas for deferring taxes on interest income."

168,Chapter 7,Interest income,What's New,,EY,TAXALERT,"A 2015 tax law changed the filing date for the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (commonly referred to as the FBAR), which is electronically filed with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Center (FinCEN) on Form 114. Reports for calendar year 2016 accounts are due April 18, 2017. (The actual annual due date has been changed to April 15th, but since April 15, 2017, falls on Saturday and the Emancipation Day holiday will be observed in the District of Columbia on Monday, April 17th, the due date for Form 114 covering 2016 is moved to April 18th.) This 2015 law also allows a six month extension to file the report for 2016 to October 16, 2017 (the actual extended due date is October 15th, but October 15, 2017, is a Sunday, the extended due date for Form 114 covering 2016 is October 16th. Under prior law, FBARs were due on June 30th of the year following the calendar year covered in the report and there was generally no extension allowed. This 2015 law also provides for the possibility of penalty relief for first-time FBAR filers who fail to timely request or file an extension."
169,Chapter 7,Interest income,What's New,,EY,Explanation,"In general, and subject to certain exceptions, persons having either a financial interest (as defined) or signature authority (as defined) over a foreign bank, brokerage or other financial account during a calendar year must report it to FinCEN (not the IRS) electronically using the BSA E-Filing System on FinCEN Form 114 (which has superseded the prior Form TDF 90-22.1, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts). The requirement to file the FBAR is separate and distinct from the requirement to report ownership of foreign financial assets on Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets. For more information, see the TAXALERT under Foreign-source income next."
170,Chapter 7,Interest income,What's New,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Foreign-source income. If you are a U.S. citizen with interest income from sources outside the United States (foreign income), you must report that income on your tax return unless it is exempt by U.S. law. This is true whether you reside inside or outside the United States and whether or not you receive a Form 1099 from the foreign payer."
171,Chapter 7,Interest income,What's New,,EY,TAXALERT,"Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, must be filed with your annual income tax return if you have an interest in specified foreign financial assets with an aggregate value of over $50,000. If a specified foreign financial asset was sold during the year, you must take the asset sold into consideration when calculating the aggregate value of specified foreign financial assets you held during the year. While most tax forms report income you receive, Form 8938 is different; it is an informational disclosure that is not used to calculate any part of your tax liability. It is used to provide information to the IRS on a range of foreign accounts and assets that may or may not actually generate taxable income. Reportable specified foreign financial assets include, but are not limited to, financial accounts located at foreign financial institutions; interests in foreign mutual funds, hedge funds, and private equity funds; directly owned foreign stock or foreign partnership interests; and beneficial interests in foreign trusts or estates. Reportable assets also include financial instruments or contracts with a foreign issuer or counterparty, a category which may include derivatives offered by non-U.S. persons, foreign deferred compensation, or pension plans and insurance contracts purchased from a foreign insurance company. If you fail to report foreign financial assets on Form 8938, you may be subject to a penalty of $10,000, and potentially an additional $50,000 penalty for continued failure to report after receiving IRS notification to file. In addition, underpayments of tax attributable to nondisclosed foreign financial assets are subject to a substantial understatement penalty of 40%. You may also have a U.S. Treasury Department filing obligation to report your financial interest in or signature authority over any financial accounts in a foreign country, if the aggregate value of these financial accounts exceeds $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. It is important to note that this rule applies to any financial accounts that you hold as an individual or through a partnership in which you have a greater than 50% ownership interest. You must report that relationship each calendar year by electronically filing a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (often referred to as the “FBAR”). FinCEN Form 114 supersedes TD F 90-22.1 (the FBAR form that was used in prior years) and is only available online through the BSA E-Filing System website. The system allows the filer to enter the calendar year reported, including past years, on the online FinCEN Form 114. It also offers an option to “explain a late filing,” or to select “Other” to enter up to 750-characters within a text box where the filer can provide a further explanation of the late filing or indicate whether the filing is made in conjunction with an IRS compliance program. Previous IRS guidance clarified that, although foreign mutual funds remain reportable financial accounts for the purpose of this reporting obligation, interests in private equity funds, hedge funds, and other “commingled funds” are not subject to reporting. Starting with FBARs covering calendar year 2016 foreign accounts and subsequent years, a 2015 tax law changes the due date for filing FinCEN Form 114 from June 30 to April 15th of the year following the year for which an FBAR must be filed. Therefore, the Form 114 that must be filed to report foreign accounts held during 2016 is due April 18, 2017. (Since April 15, 2017, falls on Saturday and the Emancipation Day holiday will be observed in the District of Columbia on Monday, April 17th, the due date for Form 114 covering 2016 is moved to April 18th.) The 2015 law also allows a six-month FBAR filing extension period ending on October 15th. A substantial penalty may apply if you fail to completely disclose your foreign accounts or file the FBAR on time. Taxpayers who have not filed a required FBAR and who are not under a civil examination or a criminal investigation by the IRS, and have not already been contacted by the IRS about a delinquent FBAR, should file any delinquent FBARs according to the FBAR instructions and include a statement explaining why the filing is late. The IRS may not impose a penalty for the failure to file the delinquent FBARs if income from the foreign financial accounts reported on the delinquent FBARs has been properly reported and associated income taxes have been paid on your U.S. income tax return. The 2015 tax act that changed the due date for filing FBARs also allows potential penalty relief for those required to file an FBAR for the first time, but who failed to submit a timely request for, or have not filed for, an extension."

If so, Form 8615, Tax for Certain Children Who Have Unearned Income, must be completed and attached to the child's tax return. If not, Form 8615 is not required and the child's income is taxed at his or her own tax rate."
180,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,EY,Tax Breaks and Deductions You Can Use Checklist,"Interest income. Interest income that is subject to federal tax is taxed as ordinary income and is subject to tax at your marginal tax rate (currently as high as 39.6%). (Interest paid on most municipal bonds is exempt from federal income tax. See Government Bond Interest, discussed later.) You should compare federally taxable interest income to qualified dividend income, which is currently subject to a 20% tax rate for taxpayers who are otherwise in the 39.6% bracket on their other ordinary income, 15% rate for taxpayers who are otherwise in the 25%, 28%, 33%, or 35% tax brackets and 0% rate for taxpayers who are otherwise in the 10% or 15% tax brackets. Although you may think that some items are dividend income, they may actually be interest—such as interest paid on a bank money market account. (Dividends on money market funds, like those sold by mutual fund companies, are dividends but are not qualified dividends.) Withholding on interest income. Interest income is usually not subject to income tax withholding. But the payer may be required to withhold tax and you may be subject to a penalty if you don't provide your correct social security number. So make sure you provide the correct information when you open an account or buy a bond. Certain interest income paid to nonresident aliens may be subject to withholding at a 30% rate under the tax law. However, there may be a tax treaty in place between the United States and the nonresident alien's home country that may reduce the withholding to a lower rate. Government bond interest. Interest on federal bonds is subject to federal taxation but not to state and local tax. Although the interest on most municipal bonds is not subject to federal income taxation, the amount of that interest earned must be reported on page 1, Line 8b, of your Form 1040. Interest on municipal “private activity” bonds is not subject to regular federal income tax but is subject to the alternative minimum tax. Family loans. If you make a loan to a member of your family (or anyone else) without charging interest, you may have to recognize interest income anyway. There are exceptions based on the size of the loan and other factors, so make sure you check out the discussion in this chapter before you make such a loan. Series E, Series EE, and Series I bonds. If you own these bonds, and are a cash method taxpayer, you can choose whether or not to report the increase in value of the bonds as income each year or instead report the interest income when the bonds are cashed in or when they reach final maturity (whichever is earlier). This enables you to control when the income is recognized. If you decide to hold off on recognizing interest earned until you redeem your bonds, consider cashing them in a year when you are subject to a low tax rate in order to minimize the tax you'll need to pay on the bonds."
181,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,EY,EXPLANATION,"The investment income of a child under age 19 (or under age 24 if the child is a full-time student) may be taxed at the parent's rate if the child does not have earned income that is more than one-half of his support. A child's support includes amounts spent to provide your child with food, lodging, medical and dental care, recreation, transportation, and similar necessities. These rules for taxing a child's investment income at their parent's rate are commonly known as the “kiddie tax.” Children whose earned income exceeds one-half of the amount of support they receive are not subject to the kiddie tax under this provision."
182,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"To avoid paying the “kiddie tax,” you should consider investments for your child that generate little or no taxable income until your child “grows out” of the reach of the kiddie tax."

185,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Amounts of net investment income that are included on your own tax return by reason of Form 8814 are included in calculating the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) that you may owe. If you may be subject to the NIIT and have children subject to the “kiddie tax,” you may consider having your children file their own tax returns to reduce the amount of income potentially subject to the NIIT."
186,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Beneficiary of an estate or trust. Interest you receive as a beneficiary of an estate or trust is generally taxable income. You should receive a Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), Beneficiary's Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc., from the fiduciary. Your copy of Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) and its instructions will tell you where to report the income on your Form 1040. Social security number (SSN). You must give your name and SSN or individual tax identification number (ITIN) to any person required by federal tax law to make a return, statement, or other document that relates to you. This includes payers of interest. If you do not give your SSN or ITIN to the payer of interest, you may have to pay a penalty. SSN for joint account. If the funds in a joint account belong to one person, list that person's name first on the account and give that person's SSN to the payer. (For information on who owns the funds in a joint account, see Joint accounts, later.) If the joint account contains combined funds, give the SSN of the person whose name is listed first on the account. This is because only one name and SSN can be shown on Form 1099. These rules apply both to joint ownership by a married couple and to joint ownership by other individuals. For example, if you open a joint savings account with your child using funds belonging to the child, list the child's name first on the account and give the child's SSN. Custodian account for your child. If your child is the actual owner of an account that is recorded in your name as custodian for the child, give the child's SSN to the payer. For example, you must give your child's SSN to the payer of interest on an account owned by your child, even though the interest is paid to you as custodian. Penalty for failure to supply SSN. If you do not give your SSN to the payer of interest, you may have to pay a penalty. See Failure to supply SSN under Penalties in chapter 1, Backup withholding also may apply."
187,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"If you change your name because of marriage, divorce, or any other reason, it is important to notify the Social Security Administration promptly. Otherwise, the IRS may believe it has discovered a reporting discrepancy that you will have to explain. In addition, you may have difficulty filing your return electronically if the name shown on your tax return doesn't match your name in the Social Security Administration's database. Finally, some taxpayers who fail to notify the government of a name change do not receive the proper credit for taxes they have paid or had withheld from wages."
188,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Backup withholding. Your interest income is generally not subject to regular withholding. However, it may be subject to backup withholding to ensure that income tax is collected on the income. Under backup withholding, the payer of interest must withhold, as income tax, on the amount you are paid, applying the appropriate withholding rate. Backup withholding may also be required if the IRS has determined that you underreported your interest or dividend income. For more information, see Backup Withholding in chapter 4. Reporting backup withholding. If backup withholding is deducted from your interest income, the payer must give you a Form 1099-INT for the year indicating the amount withheld. The Form 1099-INT will show any backup withholding as “Federal income tax withheld.”"
189,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,EY,TAXORGANIZER,You should attach Form 1099-INT to your return if it indicates that you had federal tax withheld. This will provide the IRS with complete details of how your federal income tax withheld amount was calculated.
190,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Joint accounts. If two or more persons hold property (such as a savings account or bond) as joint tenants, tenants by the entirety, or tenants in common, each person's share of any interest from the property is determined by local law."
191,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Whether or not a person receives a share of any interest from a property depends on state law and the intentions of the parties. Many people open a joint bank account with a friend or a relative so that the friend or relative may inherit the property more easily upon the owner's death. In such cases, no immediate transfer of property interest is intended. In these circumstances, the interest income should be reported solely by the owner who contributed the money. Example 1 If two brothers, Tom and Bill, have a joint brokerage account in which all the funds were contributed by Tom, with no intention of conferring any immediate benefit on Bill, all of the income should be reported by Tom. Note: To avoid an IRS deficiency notice issued through its document-matching program, Tom should make sure that his social security number is reported on Form 1099-INT. Example 2 If a husband and wife own bonds as joint tenants, tenants by the entirety, or tenants in common, and they file separate tax returns, each should include his or her share of the income. Example 3 If a parent does not transfer bonds to his or her child but uses joint tenancy so that ownership of the bonds will pass automatically to the child in case of his or her death, the income belongs to the parent. The parent's social security number should be used, and all income should be reported on the parent's return. The same applies to joint savings accounts, other bank accounts, and certificates of deposit. If a parent does intend to transfer during his or her lifetime some or all of his or her bonds to a child, a proportionate amount of interest should be included in both of their tax returns. Either person's social security number may be used. Note: Bonds, savings accounts, and the like that are in the name of a parent or other adult as custodian under a state's Uniform Gifts or Transfers to Minors Act should use the child's social security number."
192,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Since only one social security number will be recorded by the payer of interest, the IRS's document-matching program may issue deficiency notices when interest income is split between two or more returns. This situation arises because the tax return with the social security number shown on the payer's records may not include the full amount of the interest paid. To reduce the chance of receiving an IRS deficiency notice, show both the full amount of the interest paid and a subtraction for “amount attributable to others,” or “held as nominee for xx(insert name),” including their social security numbers, on Schedule B (Form 1040 or Form 1040A) in the section used for reporting distributions of income. The person who receives the other part of the interest need not worry. Although that person includes on his or her return an amount for which he or she does not receive a Form 1099-INT, the IRS rarely questions returns where income in excess of that computed by the government is reported."
193,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Income from property given to a child. Property you give as a parent to your child under the Model Gifts of Securities to Minors Act, the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, or any similar law becomes the child's property. Income from the property is taxable to the child, except that any part used to satisfy a legal obligation to support the child is taxable to the parent or guardian having that legal obligation. Savings account with parent as trustee. Interest income from a savings account opened for a minor child, but placed in the name and subject to the order of the parents as trustees, is taxable to the child if, under the law of the state in which the child resides, both of the following are true. §  The savings account legally belongs to the child. §  The parents are not legally permitted to use any of the funds to support the child. Form 1099-INT. Interest income is generally reported to you on Form 1099-INT, or a similar statement, by banks, savings and loans, and other payers of interest. This form shows you the interest you received during the year. Keep this form for your records. You do not have to attach it to your tax return."
194,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,EY,TAXSAVER,"You should attach a Form 1099-INT that shows federal or state income tax withheld to your income tax return. Also, be sure you add any amounts withheld to the total amount of taxes withheld on your income tax return."
195,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,EY,TAXALERT,"Interest paid on tax-exempt bonds is subject to information reporting in a manner similar to interest paid on taxable obligations. Issuers, brokers, and other payers are required to report tax-exempt interest paid on a Form 1099-INT issued to the recipient and the IRS. Backup withholding on such interest may apply (e.g., if the owner does not provide a taxpayer identification number)."
196,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,Report on your tax return the total interest income you receive for the tax year. See the instructions to Form 1099-INT to see whether you need to adjust any of the amounts reported to you.
197,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,EY,TAXSAVER,"The IRS contends that the figures shown on Form 1099 represent the correct amount of interest income paid to you. You have the burden of proof to demonstrate otherwise. If you have a valid reason for claiming that the correct amount is different, write on your return the amount shown on Form 1099 and then immediately show a subtraction (or addition) with an explanation for the adjustment. If you notice an error in the amount of interest stated, you should request that the payer issue a corrected Form 1099. Example You buy a bond on May 24, 2016, which pays interest once a year on December 31. Because you bought the bond between the interest payment dates, you pay, in addition to the cost of the bond, $1,000 for “purchased interest” (i.e., money to reimburse the seller for the interest that accrued between January 1, 2016, and May 23, 2016). On December 31, 2016, you receive a $3,000 interest payment, which represents interest for the period January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016. Since you did not earn the interest from January 1, 2016, through May 23, 2016, you should not have to pay income tax on this amount. Therefore, on Schedule B (Form 1040 or Form 1040A), you should report as follows:"

200,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Interest not reported on Form 1099-INT. Even if you do not receive Form 1099-INT, you must still report all of your interest income. For example, you may receive distributive shares of interest from partnerships or S corporations.

Exempt-interest dividends you receive from a mutual fund or other regulated investment company, including those received from a qualified fund of funds in any tax year beginning after December 22, 2010, are not included in your taxable income. (However, see Information reporting requirement, next.) Exempt-interest dividends should be shown in box 10 of Form 1099-DIV. You do not reduce your basis for distributions that are exempt-interest dividends. Information reporting requirement. Although exempt-interest dividends are not taxable, you must show them on your tax return if you have to file. This is an information reporting requirement and does not change the exempt-interest dividends into taxable income. Note. Exempt-interest dividends paid from specified private activity bonds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax. See Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) in chapter 31 for more information. chapter 1 of Publication 550 contains a discussion on private activity bonds under State or Local Government Obligations."
203,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,EY,TAXSAVER,"Investment income that is exempt from federal tax may still be taxable on your state tax return. This includes interest and dividends paid or accrued to you on state, municipal, or any other type of debt obligation. However, in most states, there are certain federally tax-exempt bonds that are not taxable at the state level. Be sure to check your state filing requirements before you invest in federally tax-exempt obligations. Lastly, be aware that interest from certain private activity bonds will result in an adjustment for the alternative minimum tax, even though the interest is not taxable for regular tax. See chapter 31, How to figure your tax, for more information on the alternative minimum tax."
204,Chapter 7,Interest income,General Information,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,Interest on VA dividends. Interest on insurance dividends left on deposit with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not taxable. This includes interest paid on dividends on converted United States Government Life Insurance and on National Service Life Insurance policies. Individual retirement arrangements (IRAs). Interest on a Roth IRA generally is not taxable. Interest on a traditional IRA is tax deferred. You generally do not include it in your income until you make withdrawals from the IRA. See chapter 17.
205,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Taxable interest includes interest you receive from bank accounts, loans you make to others, and other sources. The following are some sources of taxable interest. Dividends that are actually interest. Certain distributions commonly called dividends are actually interest. You must report as interest so-called “dividends” on deposits or on share accounts in: §  Cooperative banks, §  Credit unions, §  Domestic building and loan associations, §  Domestic savings and loan associations, §  Federal savings and loan associations, and §  Mutual savings banks. The “dividends” will be shown as interest income on Form 1099-INT. Money market funds. Money market funds pay dividends and are offered by nonbank financial institutions, such as mutual funds and stock brokerage houses. Generally, amounts you receive from money market funds should be reported as dividends, not as interest. Certificates of deposit and other deferred interest accounts. If you open any of these accounts, interest may be paid at fixed intervals of 1 year or less during the term of the account. You generally must include this interest in your income when you actually receive it or are entitled to receive it without paying a substantial penalty. The same is true for accounts that mature in 1 year or less and pay interest in a single payment at maturity. If interest is deferred for more than 1 year, see Original Issue Discount (OID), later. Interest subject to penalty for early withdrawal. If you withdraw funds from a deferred interest account before maturity, you may have to pay a penalty. You must report the total amount of interest paid or credited to your account during the year, without subtracting the penalty. See Penalty on early withdrawal of savings in chapter 1 of Publication 550 for more information on how to report the interest and deduct the penalty. Money borrowed to invest in certificate of deposit. The interest you pay on money borrowed from a bank or savings institution to meet the minimum deposit required for a certificate of deposit from the institution and the interest you earn on the certificate are two separate items. You must report the total interest you earn on the certificate in your income. If you itemize deductions, you can deduct the interest you pay as investment interest, up to the amount of your net investment income. See Interest Expenses in chapter 3 of Publication 550. Example. You deposited $5,000 with a bank and borrowed $5,000 from the bank to make up the $10,000 minimum deposit required to buy a 6-month certificate of deposit. The certificate earned $575 at maturity in 2016, but you received only $265, which represented the $575 you earned minus $310 interest charged on your $5,000 loan. The bank gives you a Form 1099-INT for 2016 showing the $575 interest you earned. The bank also gives you a statement showing that you paid $310 interest for 2016. You must include the $575 in your income. If you itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040), you can deduct $310, subject to the net investment income limit."
206,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Note in the previous example, the $310 of interest is deductible only if you itemize your deductions and may be further limited if you do not have net investment income (see chapter 24, Interest expense). If you are not able to fully deduct the interest you pay, you may want to reconsider the investment arrangement. Example Assuming the same facts as in the previous example, if you are in the top tax bracket, paying 43.4% (39.6% top marginal rate plus 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax), $250 of the $575 interest you earned will go to the IRS, leaving you with only $325. Since you paid $310 in interest charges (for which you receive no tax benefit if you do not itemize) to earn that $325, you have only $15 of after-tax gain on your $5,000 investment, for an after-tax rate of return of 0.3% on this investment. The impact of state income taxes should also be factored to calculate your overall after-tax rate of return."
207,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,EY,TAXSAVER,"You should be very interested in the after-tax rate of return on your investments. If your interest income is fully taxable, you may determine your after-tax rate of return in the following manner. First, determine from the Tax Rate Schedules (see chapter 51) what you expect your highest marginal tax rate to be by calculating your total taxable income and then determining the highest rate at which it will be taxed. If the rate is, say, 33%, then the IRS gets 33% of your interest income on any investment, and you keep 67%. Thus, if you earn 10% on a bank deposit, your after-tax rate of return is really 6.7% (10% × 67%). See the chart later in this chapter in the State or Local Government Obligations section for a comparison of after-tax yields with the yield of municipal bonds. As the chart indicates, you should remember to include your state and local taxes when computing your marginal tax rate."
208,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Gift for opening account. If you receive noncash gifts or services for making deposits or for opening an account in a savings institution, you may have to report the value as interest."
209,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Incentive items received (e.g., a $50 “new account” credit from a bank) may be considered income to you, not a tax-free gift. In cases such as this, you may have taxable income."
210,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"For deposits of less than $5,000, gifts or services valued at more than $10 must be reported as interest. For deposits of $5,000 or more, gifts or services valued at more than $20 must be reported as interest. The value is determined by the cost to the financial institution. Example. You open a savings account at your local bank and deposit $800. The account earns $20 interest. You also receive a $15 calculator. If no other interest is credited to your account during the year, the Form 1099-INT you receive will show $35 interest for the year. You must report $35 interest income on your tax return. Interest on insurance dividends. Interest on insurance dividends left on deposit with an insurance company that can be withdrawn annually is taxable to you in the year it is credited to your account. However, if you can withdraw it only on the anniversary date of the policy (or other specified date), the interest is taxable in the year that date occurs."
211,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Remember to distinguish between the insurance dividend and the interest on that dividend. An insurance dividend is the amount of your premium that is paid back to you if your insurance company achieves a lower mortality cost on policyholders than it expected. An insurance dividend is treated as an adjustment to your insurance premium and is therefore not taxable income to you unless it exceeds your premium. If you leave this dividend on deposit with the insurance company, however, any interest you receive on it should be included as interest income, just as it would be if you had left the money in the bank."
212,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"If you receive Form 1099-INT from an insurance company every year, you may have an untapped source of cash at your disposal. This form usually indicates that insurance dividends paid in prior years are accumulating in a savings account paying passbook rates. This money might be better invested in money market funds or other investments paying higher rates. To find out if you have money you did not know about, contact your insurance agent."
213,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Prepaid insurance premiums. Any increase in the value of prepaid insurance premiums, advance premiums, or premium deposit funds is interest if it is applied to the payment of premiums due on insurance policies or made available for you to withdraw. U.S. obligations. Interest on U.S. obligations, such as U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds, issued by any agency or instrumentality of the United States is taxable for federal income tax purposes."
214,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Interest income on U.S. obligations is not subject to state and local income tax; therefore, if your state has a high income tax rate, investing in U.S. obligations, rather than in instruments taxable at the state level, could mean a significant tax savings overall. Most states include in their filing instructions a list of U.S. obligations that are exempt for state income tax purposes. Be sure to consult the state instructions to confirm that the interest income from federal obligations you own are exempt for your state. Nevertheless, interest paid on federal tax refunds is taxable by both the state and the federal governments."
215,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Interest on tax refunds. Interest you receive on tax refunds is taxable income. Interest on condemnation award. If the condemning authority pays you interest to compensate you for a delay in payment of an award, the interest is taxable."
216,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Even if the condemning authority is a state or local government, the interest on the award is taxable. The logic is as follows: The interest arises out of the government's exercise of its eminent domain power and not through the exercise of its borrowing power."
217,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Installment sale payments. If a contract for the sale or exchange of property provides for deferred payments, it also usually provides for interest payable with the deferred payments. Generally, that interest is taxable when you receive it. If little or no interest is provided for in a deferred payment contract, part of each payment may be treated as interest. See Unstated Interest and Original Issue Discount in Publication 537, Installment Sales."
218,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Congress has clamped down on a transaction structure that was once used with great success. The idea was to sell a piece of real estate at an inflated price in order to receive a larger long-term capital gain and, in turn, agree to accept deferred payments carrying a low interest rate. The strategy was to give up interest income taxed at ordinary rates and replace it with a larger long-term capital gain taxed at a lower rate. Under legislation effective for debt instruments issued after December 31, 1984, payments must be made on a current basis, and certain tests are applied to determine if the interest rate is appropriate. If it isn't, a portion of each payment is recharacterized as interest. Because the rules are very complex, you should obtain professional assistance when you are negotiating a deal and making the necessary computations. The rules are not applicable to sales of less than $250,000, the sale of your principal residence, or sales for less than $1 million of a farm used by the seller as a farm. However, in these situations, the IRS has the authority to recharacterize a transaction if the stipulated interest rate falls below the published federal rate. In such cases, the IRS would reduce the amount of the capital gain and increase the interest income."
219,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Interest on annuity contract. Accumulated interest on an annuity contract you sell before its maturity date is taxable. Usurious interest. Usurious interest is interest charged at an illegal rate. This is taxable as interest unless state law automatically changes it to a payment on the principal. Interest income on frozen deposits. Exclude from your gross income interest on frozen deposits. A deposit is frozen if, at the end of the year, you cannot withdraw any part of the deposit because: §  The financial institution is bankrupt or insolvent, or §  The state where the institution is located has placed limits on withdrawals because other financial institutions in the state are bankrupt or insolvent. The amount of interest you must exclude is the interest that was credited on the frozen deposits minus the sum of: §  The net amount you withdrew from these deposits during the year, and §  The amount you could have withdrawn as of the end of the year (not reduced by any penalty for premature withdrawals of a time deposit). If you receive a Form 1099-INT for interest income on deposits that were frozen at the end of 2016, see Frozen deposits under How To Report Interest Income in chapter 1 of Publication 550, for information about reporting this interest income exclusion on your tax return. The interest you exclude is treated as credited to your account in the following year. You must include it in income in the year you can withdraw it. Example. $100 of interest was credited on your frozen deposit during the year. You withdrew $80 but could not withdraw any more as of the end of the year. You must include $80 in your income and exclude $20 from your income for the year. You must include the $20 in your income for the year you can withdraw it. Bonds traded flat. If you buy a bond at a discount when interest has been defaulted or when the interest has accrued but has not been paid, the transaction is described as trading a bond flat. The defaulted or unpaid interest is not income and is not taxable as interest if paid later. When you receive a payment of that interest, it is a return of capital that reduces the remaining cost basis of your bond. Interest that accrues after the date of purchase, however, is taxable interest income for the year it is received or accrued. See Bonds Sold Between Interest Dates, later, for more information. Below-market loans. In general, a below-market loan is a loan on which no interest is charged or on which interest is charged at a rate below the applicable federal rate. See Below-Market Loans in chapter 1 of Publication 550 for more information."
220,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,,EY,EXPLANATION,"If you make a below-market loan, you must report as interest income any forgone interest (defined next) arising from that loan. How you should report the income as well as the application of the below-market loan rules and exceptions are described in this section. If you receive a below-market loan, you may be able to claim a deduction for interest expense in excess of the interest that you actually paid–but only if you use the funds to buy investment property. Forgone interest. For any period, forgone interest is: 1. The amount of interest that would be payable for that period if interest accrued on the loan at the applicable federal rate and was payable annually on December 31, minus 2. Any interest actually payable on the loan for the period. The applicable federal rate is set by the IRS each month and is published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. You can also contact an IRS office to get these rates. Below-market loans. A below-market loan is a loan on which no interest is charged or on which interest is charged at a rate below the applicable federal rate. A below-market loan is generally recharacterized as an arm's length transaction in which the lender is treated as having made: 1. A loan to the borrower in exchange for a note that requires the payment of interest at the applicable federal rate, and 2. An additional payment to the borrower. The lender's additional payment to the borrower is treated as a gift, dividend, contribution to capital, payment of compensation, or other payment, depending on the substance of the transaction. The borrower may have to report this payment as taxable income depending on its classification. Loans subject to the rules. The rules for below-market loans apply to: ·    Gift loans ·    Compensation-related loans ·    Corporation-shareholder loans ·    Tax avoidance loans ·    Certain loans to qualified continuing care facilities (made after October 11, 1985) ·    Certain other below-market loans Exceptions The rules for below-market loans do not apply to certain loans on days on which the total outstanding amount of loans between the borrower and lender is $10,000 or less. The rules do not apply on those days to: 1. Gift loans between individuals if the gift loan is not directly used to purchase or carry income-producing assets 2. Compensation-related loans or corporation-shareholder loans if the avoidance of federal tax is not a principal purpose of the loan A compensation-related loan is any below-market loan between an employer and an employee or between an independent contractor and a person for whom the contractor provided services. Other loans not subject to the rules. Other loans are excluded from the below-market loan rules, including: 1. Loans made available by the lender to the general public on the same terms and conditions and that are consistent with the lender's customary business practice. 2. Loans subsidized by a federal, state, or municipal government that are made available under a program of general application to the public. 3. Certain employee-relocation loans. 4. Loans to or from a foreign person, unless the interest income would be effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business and would not be exempt from U.S. tax under an income tax treaty. 5. Gift loans to a charitable organization, contributions to which are deductible, if the total outstanding amount of the loans between the organization and the lender is $250,000 or less at all times during the tax year. 6. Other loans on which the interest arrangement can be shown to have no significant effect on the federal tax liability of the lender or the borrower. 7. Certain refundable loans to a qualified continuing care facility under a continuing care contract. The reporting of interest income from loans to continuing care facilities is subject to the rules for below-market loans unless certain requirements are met. However, there is no dollar limit on the total outstanding loan balance for these loans if the lender or the lender's spouse is at least 62 years old and is to receive services under the continuing care service contract. It is important to understand the definition of a qualified continuing care facility and the type of services allowed for purposes of this loan type. Facilities which are of a type traditionally considered as nursing homes are not considered continuing care facilities. A continuing care facility which falls under this exception must: (1) provide service under a continuing care contract, (2) include an independent living unit, plus an assisted living or nursing facility, or both, and (3) substantially all of the independent living unit residents living there must be covered by continuing care contracts. For more information, see Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses, and consult your tax advisor. If a taxpayer structures a transaction to be a loan not subject to the below-market loan rules, and one of the principal purposes of structuring the transaction in such a way is to avoid federal tax, then the IRS may consider the loan to be a tax-avoidance scheme and, as such, subject the loan to the rules for below-market loans. All the facts and circumstances are used to determine if the interest arrangement of a loan has a significant effect on the federal tax liability of the lender or borrower. Some factors to be considered are: ·    Whether income and deduction items generated by the loan offset each other ·    The amount of such items ·    The cost to the taxpayer of complying with the below-market loan provisions, if they applied ·    Any reasons other than tax-avoidance purposes for structuring the transaction as a below-market loan Gift and demand loans. A gift loan is any below-market loan where the forgone interest is in the nature of a gift. A demand loan is a loan payable in full at any time upon demand by the lender. A lender who makes a gift loan or demand loan is treated as transferring an additional payment to the borrower (as a gift, dividend, etc.) in an amount equal to the forgone interest. The borrower is treated as transferring the forgone interest to the lender and may be entitled to an interest expense deduction depending on the use of the monies borrowed. The lender must report that amount as interest income. These transfers are considered to occur annually, generally on December 31. Example 1 Jill's grandmother makes an interest-free loan to Jill on July 1 for $50,000. Jill has net investment income from outside sources of $5,000. The applicable federal interest rate is 5% at this time. This loan will be treated as a gift loan. On December 31, Jill will be treated as having paid her grandmother $1,250 in interest and her grandmother must report $1,250 of interest income and as a gift, even though no money has changed hands. Special rules for gift loans between individuals that do not exceed $100,000. For gift loans that do not exceed $100,000, the amount of forgone interest that is treated as transferred by the borrower to the lender is limited. This limit is the borrower's net investment income for the year, unless one of the principal purposes of the loan is the avoidance of federal tax. Also, if a borrower has net investment income of $1,000 or less for the year, the borrower's net investment income is considered to be zero and the borrower will have no interest expense deduction. Example 2 Using the same facts in Example 1, assume Jill has $1,100 in net investment income for the year. On December 31, Jill will be treated as having paid her grandmother $1,100 in interest (not $1,250) because of the net investment income limitation. Jill's grandmother would include the $1,100 as interest income. Term loans. A lender who makes a below-market term loan (a loan that is not a demand loan) is treated as transferring, as a gift, dividend, etc., an additional lump-sum cash payment to the borrower on the date the loan is made. The amount of this payment is the amount of the loan minus the present value of all payments due under the loan. An amount equal to this excess is treated as an original issue discount (OID). Accordingly, the OID rules of Section 1272 of the Internal Revenue Code apply. The lender must report the annual part of the OID as interest income. The borrower may be able to deduct some or all of the excess as interest expense depending on the use of the monies borrowed. The OID rules are discussed in greater detail later in this chapter. Effective dates. These rules apply to term loans made after June 6, 1984, as well as to demand loans outstanding after that date."

If you use an accrual method of accounting, you must report interest on U.S. savings bonds each year as it accrues. You cannot postpone reporting interest until you receive it or until the bonds mature. Accrual methods of accounting are explained in chapter 1 under Accounting Methods. Cash method taxpayers. If you use the cash method of accounting, as most individual taxpayers do, you generally report the interest on U.S. savings bonds when you receive it. The cash method of accounting is explained in chapter 1 under Accounting Methods. But see Reporting options for cash method taxpayers, later. Series HH bonds. These bonds were issued at face value. Interest is paid twice a year by direct deposit to your bank account. If you are a cash method taxpayer, you must report interest on these bonds as income in the year you receive it. Series HH bonds were first offered in 1980 and last offered in August 2004. Before 1980, series H bonds were issued. Series H bonds are treated the same as series HH bonds. If you are a cash method taxpayer, you must report the interest when you receive it. Series H bonds have a maturity period of 30 years. Series HH bonds mature in 20 years. The last series H bonds matured in 2009. Series EE and series I bonds. Interest on these bonds is payable when you redeem the bonds. The difference between the purchase price and the redemption value is taxable interest. Series EE bonds. Series EE bonds were first offered in January 1980 and have a maturity period of 30 years. Before July 1980, series E bonds were issued. The original 10-year maturity period of series E bonds has been extended to 40 years for bonds issued before December 1965 and 30 years for bonds issued after November 1965. Paper series EE and series E bonds are issued at a discount. The face value is payable to you at maturity. Electronic series EE bonds are issued at their face value. The face value plus accrued interest is payable to you at maturity. As of January 1, 2012, paper savings bonds were no longer sold at financial institutions. Owners of paper series EE bonds can convert them to electronic bonds. These converted bonds do not retain the denomination listed on the paper certificate but are posted at their purchase price (with accrued interest). Series I bonds. Series I bonds were first offered in 1998. These are inflation-indexed bonds issued at their face amount with a maturity period of 30 years. The face value plus all accrued interest is payable to you at maturity. Reporting options for cash method taxpayers. If you use the cash method of reporting income, you can report the interest on series EE, series E, and series I bonds in either of the following ways."
222,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,EY,Tip,"If you plan to cash your bonds in the same year you will pay for higher education expenses, you may want to use method 1 because you may be able to exclude the interest from your income. To learn how, see Education Savings Bond Program, later."
223,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"1.    Method 1. Postpone reporting the interest until the earlier of the year you cash or dispose of the bonds or the year they mature. (However, see Savings bonds traded, later.) 2.    Method 2. Choose to report the increase in redemption value as interest each year. You must use the same method for all series EE, series E, and series I bonds you own. If you do not choose method 2 by reporting the increase in redemption value as interest each year, you must use method 1. Change from method 1. If you want to change your method of reporting the interest from method 1 to method 2, you can do so without permission from the IRS. In the year of change you must report all interest accrued to date and not previously reported for all your bonds. Once you choose to report the interest each year, you must continue to do so for all series EE, series E, and series I bonds you own and for any you get later, unless you request permission to change, as explained next. Change from method 2. To change from method 2 to method 1, you must request permission from the IRS. Permission for the change is automatically granted if you send the IRS a statement that meets all the following requirements. 1.    You have typed or printed the following number at the top: “131.” 2.    It includes your name and social security number under “131.” 3.    It includes the year of change (both the beginning and ending dates). 4.    It identifies the savings bonds for which you are requesting this change. 5.    It includes your agreement to: a. Report all interest on any bonds acquired during or after the year of change when the interest is realized upon disposition, redemption, or final maturity, whichever is earliest, and b. Report all interest on the bonds acquired before the year of change when the interest is realized upon disposition, redemption, or final maturity, whichever is earliest, with the exception of the interest reported in prior tax years. You must attach this statement to your tax return for the year of change, which you must file by the due date (including extensions). You can have an automatic extension of 6 months from the due date of your return for the year of change (excluding extensions) to file the statement with an amended return. To get this extension, you must have filed your original return for the year of the change by the due date (including extensions). By the date you file the original statement with your return, you must also send a signed copy to the address below. Internal Revenue Service 201 West Rivercenter   Blvd. PIN Team Mail Stop 97 Covington, KY 41011-1424 Instead of filing this statement, you can request permission to change from method 2 to method 1 by filing Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method. In that case, follow the form instructions for an automatic change. No user fee is required."
224,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,EY,EXPLANATION,"Series E, Series EE, and Series I bonds are unique investments from a tax viewpoint. Since you, as a cash method taxpayer, may decide not to report the increase in value of the bonds as income each year and instead may decide to report the interest income when the bonds are cashed in or when they reach final maturity (whichever is earlier), you can—to an unusual extent—control when the income is recognized. The best time to redeem the bonds is a year in which you have low taxable income and a low tax rate. Few people choose to report income annually rather than at sale or maturity, but if you do, you would report as income the increase in the redemption value of each bond each year. All you must do is report the income on your tax return. It would be advantageous to report the income annually only if you had an income so low that your personal exemption and itemized deductions or standard deduction might otherwise be wasted. The most likely people to choose this option are retired people and children over 18 years old in 2016 (or, if a full-time student, over age 23), both of whom may have low taxable income. (Income received by children under age 19 or, if a full-time student, under age 24, may be taxed at their parents’ rate.) Remember, once you choose to report the income each year, you must obtain permission from the IRS to change your reporting method. Example A 70-year-old unmarried man with only $1,500 of other income might wish to report his savings bond interest each year, since his first $11,900 of income (his standard deduction and exemption) is tax-free in 2016. If he holds the bonds and reports all the income in the year they mature, his taxable income in that year might be more than $11,900, and he would therefore pay taxes he could have otherwise avoided by reporting a smaller amount of interest each year over the life of the bond. Explanation The interest rate on Series EE bonds varies depending upon when the bonds were purchased. The method of calculating the interest rate is different for bonds purchased prior to May 1, 1995, between May 1, 1995, and April 30, 1997, and after May 1, 1997. The interest rate on Series I bonds, the value of which is adjusted with inflation, also changes periodically. The Treasury site at www.publicdebt.treas.gov has more details. Millions of Series E and H bonds continue to be held by the public. Most are still earning interest due to extended maturity rates. Some, however, have reached their final maturity and should be exchanged or redeemed. Prior to September 1, 2004, Series HH bonds could be obtained in exchange for outstanding eligible Series EE bonds and Series E bonds having a combined redemption value of $500 or more. Owners who deferred reporting interest earned on the bonds that they exchange can continue to defer the interest until the year in which the Series HH bonds received in the exchange are redeemed, reach final maturity, or are otherwise disposed of. Although Series H bonds cannot be exchanged for Series HH bonds (nor can Series E bonds be exchanged for Series EE bonds), the redemption proceeds can be reinvested in new series bonds. However, any previously tax-deferred interest must be reported for federal income tax purposes in the year of redemption."
225,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,EY,TAXPLANNER,"For most bonds issued prior to May 1997, interest is credited to U.S. savings bonds at specified dates (i.e., there is no proration of interest for bonds cashed during the middle of an interest period). Thus, you should plan ahead to cash in your bonds just after (versus just before) an interest credit date."
226,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Co-owners. If a U.S. savings bond is issued in the names of co-owners, such as you and your child or you and your spouse, interest on the bond is generally taxable to the co-owner who bought the bond. One co-owner's funds used. If you used your funds to buy the bond, you must pay the tax on the interest. This is true even if you let the other co-owner redeem the bond and keep all the proceeds. Under these circumstances, the co-owner who redeemed the bond will receive a Form 1099-INT at the time of redemption and must provide you with another Form 1099-INT showing the amount of interest from the bond taxable to you. The co-owner who redeemed the bond is a “nominee.” See Nominee distributions under How To Report Interest Income in chapter 1 of Publication 550 for more information about how a person who is a nominee reports interest income belonging to another person. Both co-owners’ funds used. If you and the other co-owner each contribute part of the bond's purchase price, the interest is generally taxable to each of you, in proportion to the amount each of you paid. Community property. If you and your spouse live in a community property state and hold bonds as community property, one-half of the interest is considered received by each of you. If you file separate returns, each of you generally must report one-half of the bond interest. For more information about community property, see Publication 555. Table 7-1. These rules are also shown in Table 7-1. Table 7-1. Who Pays the Tax on U.S. Savings Bond Interest IF … THEN the interest    must be reported by … you buy a bond in your name and the name of another   person as co-owners, using only your own funds you. you buy a bond in the name of another person, who is the   sole owner of the bond the person for whom you bought the bond. you and another person buy a bond as co-owners, each   contributing part of the purchase price both you and the other co-owner, in proportion to the   amount each paid for the bond. you and your spouse, who live in a community property   state, buy a bond that is community property you and your spouse. If you file separate returns, both   you and your spouse generally report one-half of the interest. Ownership transferred. If you bought series E, series EE, or series I bonds entirely with your own funds and had them reissued in your co-owner's name or beneficiary's name alone, you must include in your gross income for the year of reissue all interest that you earned on these bonds and have not previously reported. But, if the bonds were reissued in your name alone, you do not have to report the interest accrued at that time. This same rule applies when bonds (other than bonds held as community property) are transferred between spouses or incident to divorce."
227,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,EY,EXPLANATION,"If you make a gift of Series E, Series EE, or Series I bonds to a child, remember that it is not possible to transfer the obligation of reporting the interest income that has already accumulated. The interest that has accumulated through the date of the gift must be reported by the donor in the year of the gift. Interest that accumulates from the date of the gift until maturity is reported by the individual receiving the gift."
228,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Purchased jointly. If you and a co-owner each contributed funds to buy series E, series EE, or series I bonds jointly and later have the bonds reissued in the co-owner's name alone, you must include in your gross income for the year of reissue your share of all the interest earned on the bonds that you have not previously reported. The former co-owner does not have to include in gross income at the time of reissue his or her share of the interest earned that was not reported before the transfer. This interest, however, as well as all interest earned after the reissue, is income to the former co-owner. This income-reporting rule also applies when the bonds are reissued in the name of your former co-owner and a new co-owner. But the new co-owner will report only his or her share of the interest earned after the transfer. If bonds that you and a co-owner bought jointly are reissued to each of you separately in the same proportion as your contribution to the purchase price, neither you nor your co-owner has to report at that time the interest earned before the bonds were reissued. Example 1. You and your spouse each spent an equal amount to buy a $1,000 series EE savings bond. The bond was issued to you and your spouse as co-owners. You both postpone reporting interest on the bond. You later have the bond reissued as two $500 bonds, one in your name and one in your spouse's name. At that time neither you nor your spouse has to report the interest earned to the date of reissue. Example 2. You bought a $1,000 series EE savings bond entirely with your own funds. The bond was issued to you and your spouse as co-owners. You both postpone reporting interest on the bond. You later have the bond reissued as two $500 bonds, one in your name and one in your spouse's name. You must report half the interest earned to the date of reissue. Transfer to a trust. If you own series E, series EE, or series I bonds and transfer them to a trust, giving up all rights of ownership, you must include in your income for that year the interest earned to the date of transfer if you have not already reported it. However, if you are considered the owner of the trust and if the increase in value both before and after the transfer continues to be taxable to you, you can continue to defer reporting the interest earned each year. You must include the total interest in your income in the year you cash or dispose of the bonds or the year the bonds finally mature, whichever is earlier. The same rules apply to previously unreported interest on series EE or series E bonds if the transfer to a trust consisted of series HH or series H bonds you acquired in a trade for the series EE or series E bonds. See Savings bonds traded, later."
229,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,EY,TAXSAVER,"If you transfer the bonds to a revocable trust, of which you are considered the owner, you may continue to defer reporting the income. Many individuals use a revocable trust as a substitute for a will. A revocable trust is not required to pay federal income tax on income earned in the trust. Instead, all income (and deductions) is reported on your individual tax return, as if the revocable trust did not exist. In essence, you are treated as if you owned the assets outright. For more details, consult your tax advisor."
230,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Decedents. The manner of reporting interest income on series E, series EE, or series I bonds, after the death of the owner (decedent), depends on the accounting and income-reporting methods previously used by the decedent. This is explained in chapter 1 of Publication 550."
231,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,EY,EXPLANATION,"Income that the decedent had a right to receive at the time of death, but which is included on another's tax return (or the estate tax return), is called “income in respect of the decedent.” See chapter 44, Decedents: Dealing with the death of a family member, for more information."
232,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,EY,TAXPLANNER,"If the final income tax return of the decedent shows a low amount of taxable income, it would be better to include the interest income from the date of purchase of the bonds through the date of death, the choice described in Example 1. Otherwise, the IRS says that the interest income must be reported by the person who receives the bonds, the choice described in Example 2. However, there is a third option. If the bonds are in the name of the decedent alone, their ownership passes to the estate. The estate is a separate taxable entity that files its own income tax return. If the estate has a low amount of taxable income, it might be advisable for the executor to redeem the bonds. A point to remember is this: The unique method by which interest from U.S. savings bonds is taxed gives you an opportunity to reduce income tax by selecting the person or entity with the lowest tax rate to receive the income. Example 1 Your uncle, a cash method taxpayer, died and left you a $1,000 Series E bond. He bought the bond for $750 and chose not to report the interest each year. At the date of death, interest of $200 had accrued on the bond and its value of $950 was included in your uncle's estate. Your uncle's executor did not choose to include the $200 accrued interest in your uncle's final income tax return. You are a cash method taxpayer and do not choose to report the interest each year as it is earned. If you cash the bond when it reaches its maturity value of $1,000, you will report $250 of interest income–the difference between the maturity value of $1,000 and the original cost of $750. Also, you may deduct (as a miscellaneous deduction not subject to the 2% AGI limit) in that year any federal estate tax that was paid on the $200 of interest that was included in your uncle's estate. For more information on this subject, see chapter 44, Decedents: Dealing with the death of a family member. Example 2 If, in Example 1, the executor had chosen to include the $200 accrued interest in your uncle's final tax return, you would report only $50 as interest when you cashed the bond at maturity. This $50 is the interest earned after your uncle's death. Example 3 Your aunt died owning Series H bonds that she got in a trade for Series E bonds. (See Savings bonds traded, in the next section.) You were the beneficiary of these bonds. Your aunt used the cash method and did not choose to report the interest on the Series E bonds each year as it accrued. Your aunt's executor did not choose to include on her final tax return any interest earned before her death. The income in respect of a decedent is the sum of the unreported interest on the Series E bonds and the interest, if any, payable on the Series H bonds but not received as of the date of your aunt's death. You must report any interest received during the year as income on your return. The part of the interest that was payable but not received before your aunt's death is income in respect of the decedent and may qualify for the estate tax deduction. For when to report the interest on the Series E bonds traded, see Savings bonds traded, in the next section."
233,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,EY,TAXPLANNER,"There is an annual limitation on the purchase of Series EE and Series I bonds. Over-the-counter sales of paper bonds at financial institutions ended December 31, 2012, however, an individual may purchase a total of up to $20,000 (face amount), each, of Series EE and Series I bonds electronically per year. Because bonds are sold for one-half their face value, this means you can spend no more than $10,000 on electronic Series EE or Series I bonds per year. In addition, you may buy an additional $10,000 of Series I paper bonds each year with up to $5,000 of your federal income tax refund by checking the appropriate box (Form 1040EZ, line 11a; Form 1040A, line 43a; or Form 1040, line 74a) and attaching Form 8888, Allocation of Refund (Including Savings Bond Purchases) to your income tax return."
234,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Savings bonds traded. If you postponed reporting the interest on your series EE or series E bonds, you did not recognize taxable income when you traded the bonds for series HH or series H bonds, unless you received cash in the trade. (You cannot trade series I bonds for series HH bonds. After August 31, 2004, you cannot trade any other series of bonds for series HH bonds.) Any cash you received is income up to the amount of the interest earned on the bonds traded. When your series HH or series H bonds mature, or if you dispose of them before maturity, you report as interest the difference between their redemption value and your cost. Your cost is the sum of the amount you paid for the traded series EE or series E bonds plus any amount you had to pay at the time of the trade. Example. You traded series EE bonds (on which you postponed reporting the interest) for $2,500 in series HH bonds and $223 in cash. You reported the $223 as taxable income on your tax return. At the time of the trade, the series EE bonds had accrued interest of $523 and a redemption value of $2,723. You hold the series HH bonds until maturity, when you receive $2,500. You must report $300 as interest income in the year of maturity. This is the difference between their redemption value, $2,500, and your cost, $2,200 (the amount you paid for the series EE bonds). (It is also the difference between the accrued interest of $523 on the series EE bonds and the $223 cash received on the trade.) Choice to report interest in year of trade. You could have chosen to treat all of the previously unreported accrued interest on the series EE or series E bonds traded for series HH bonds as income in the year of the trade. If you made this choice, it is treated as a change from method 1. See Change from method 1 under Series EE and series I bonds, earlier. Form 1099-INT for U.S. savings bonds interest. When you cash a bond, the bank or other payer that redeems it must give you a Form 1099-INT if the interest part of the payment you receive is $10 or more. Box 3 of your Form 1099-INT should show the interest as the difference between the amount you received and the amount paid for the bond. However, your Form 1099-INT may show more interest than you have to include on your income tax return. For example, this may happen if any of the following are true. §  You chose to report the increase in the redemption value of the bond each year. The interest shown on your Form 1099-INT will not be reduced by amounts previously included in income. §  You received the bond from a decedent. The interest shown on your Form 1099-INT will not be reduced by any interest reported by the decedent before death, or on the decedent's final return, or by the estate on the estate's income tax return. §  Ownership of the bond was transferred. The interest shown on your Form 1099-INT will not be reduced by interest that accrued before the transfer. §  You were named as a co-owner, and the other co-owner contributed funds to buy the bond. The interest shown on your Form 1099-INT will not be reduced by the amount you received as nominee for the other co-owner. (See Co-owners, earlier in this chapter, for more information about the reporting requirements.) §  You received the bond in a taxable distribution from a retirement or profit-sharing plan. The interest shown on your Form 1099-INT will not be reduced by the interest portion of the amount taxable as a distribution from the plan and not taxable as interest. (This amount is generally shown on Form 1099-R, Distributions From Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc., for the year of distribution.) For more information on including the correct amount of interest on your return, see How To Report Interest Income, later. Publication 550 includes examples showing how to report these amounts."
235,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,EY,Tip,Interest on U.S. savings bonds is exempt from state and local taxes. The Form 1099-INT you receive will indicate the amount that is for U.S. savings bond interest in box  3.
236,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,U.S. Savings Bonds,EY,EXPLANATION,"When you redeem U.S. savings bonds, the government assumes that the difference between the issue price and the redemption amount is interest paid to you entirely at that time, even though some of the interest may already have been reported by you or someone else. The government will therefore issue a Form 1099-INT to you for the full amount. If you should not be taxed on the full amount of interest, you should show the full amount as reported on the Form 1099-INT issued by the government on Schedule B (Form 1040 or Form 1040A) and also show a subtraction for the amount that is not taxable to you. This will help you to avoid IRS matching notices."
237,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Education Savings Bond Program,TaxCode,TAXCODE,You may be able to exclude from income all or part of the interest you receive on the redemption of qualified U.S. savings bonds during the year if you pay qualified higher educational expenses during the same year. This exclusion is known as the Education Savings Bond Program. You do not qualify for this exclusion if your filing status is married filing separately.
238,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Education Savings Bond Program,EY,TAXPLANNER,"For 2016, the amount of your Education Savings Bond Program interest exclusion is phased out if your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is between $77,550 and $92,550 (between $116,300 and $146,300 if your filing status is married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er))."
239,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Education Savings Bond Program,EY,Caution,The issue date of a bond may be earlier than the date the bond is purchased because the issue date assigned to a bond is the first day of the month in which it is purchased.

For example, a bond bought by a parent and issued in the name of his or her child under age 24 does not qualify for the exclusion by the parent or child. Beneficiary. You can designate any individual (including a child) as a beneficiary of the bond. Verification by IRS. If you claim the exclusion, the IRS will check it by using bond redemption information from the Department of the Treasury. Qualified expenses. Qualified higher educational expenses are tuition and fees required for you, your spouse, or your dependent (for whom you claim an exemption) to attend an eligible educational institution. Qualified expenses include any contribution you make to a qualified tuition program or to a Coverdell education savings account. Qualified expenses do not include expenses for room and board or for courses involving sports, games, or hobbies that are not part of a degree or certificate granting program. Eligible educational institutions. These institutions include most public, private, and nonprofit universities, colleges, and vocational schools that are accredited and eligible to participate in student aid programs run by the U.S. Department of Education. Reduction for certain benefits. You must reduce your qualified higher educational expenses by all of the following tax-free benefits. 1.    Tax-free part of scholarships and fellowships (see Scholarships and fellowships in chapter 12). 2.    Expenses used to figure the tax-free portion of distributions from a Coverdell ESA. 3.    Expenses used to figure the tax-free portion of distributions from a qualified tuition program. 4.    Any tax-free payments (other than gifts or inheritances) received for educational expenses, such as a. Veterans’ educational assistance benefits, b. Qualified tuition reductions, or c. Employer-provided educational assistance. 5.    Any expense used in figuring the American Opportunity and lifetime learning credits."
241,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Education Savings Bond Program,EY,EXPLANATION,These reductions help you arrive at your “adjusted qualified higher educational expenses.”
242,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Education Savings Bond Program,EY,TAXORGANIZER,"You should keep bills, receipts, canceled checks, and other documentation that show you paid qualified higher education expenses."
243,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Education Savings Bond Program,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Amount excludable. If the total proceeds (interest and principal) from the qualified U.S. savings bonds you redeem during the year are not more than your adjusted qualified higher educational expenses for the year, you may be able to exclude all of the interest. If the proceeds are more than the expenses, you may be able to exclude only part of the interest. To determine the excludable amount, multiply the interest part of the proceeds by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the qualified higher educational expenses you paid during the year. The denominator of the fraction is the total proceeds you received during the year. Example. In February 2016, Mark and Joan, a married couple, cashed a qualified series EE U.S. savings bonds with a total denomination of $10,000 that they bought in April 1999 for $5,000. They received proceeds of $8,060 representing principal of $5,000 and interest of $3,060. In 2016, they paid $4,000 of their daughter's college tuition. They are not claiming an education credit for that amount, and their daughter does not have any tax-free educational assistance. They can exclude $1,519 ($3,060 × ($4,000 ÷ $8,060)) of interest in 2016. They must include the remaining $1,541 ($3,060 − $1,519) interest in gross income."
244,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Education Savings Bond Program,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Certain high-income taxpayers do not qualify for the tax break on Series EE or Series I bonds for educational purposes. If this is the case, you might consider buying the bonds in your child's name. This may trigger gift tax if the taxpayer purchasing the bonds exceeds the applicable annual per donee exclusion amount (see chapter 45, Estate and gift tax planning). If a child's earned income exceeds at least one-half of the amount of support he or she receives, and the child was either age 18 by the end of 2016 or a full-time student between the ages of 18 and 24, he or she may cash in the bonds and be taxed at his or her rate, rather than yours, which is presumably higher."
245,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Education Savings Bond Program,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Modified adjusted gross income limit. The interest exclusion is limited if your modified adjusted gross income (modified AGI) is: §  $77,550 to $92,550 for taxpayers filing single or head of household, and §  $116,300 to $146,300 for married taxpayers filing jointly or for a qualifying widow(er) with dependent child. You do not qualify for the interest exclusion if your modified AGI is equal to or more than the upper limit for your filing status. Modified AGI, for purposes of this exclusion, is adjusted gross income (Form 1040, line 37, or Form 1040A, line 21) figured before the interest exclusion, and modified by adding back any: 1.    Foreign earned income exclusion, 2.    Foreign housing exclusion and deduction, 3.    Exclusion of income for bona fide residents of American Samoa, 4.    Exclusion for income from Puerto Rico, 5.    Exclusion for adoption benefits received under an employer's adoption assistance program, 6.    Deduction for tuition and fees, 7.    Deduction for student loan interest, and 8.    Deduction for domestic production activities.

If you have investment interest expense incurred to earn royalties and other investment income, see Education Savings Bond Program in chapter 1 of Publication 550. Recordkeeping. If you claim the interest exclusion, you must keep a written record of the qualified U.S. savings bonds you redeem. Your record must include the serial number, issue date, face value, and total redemption proceeds (principal and interest) of each bond. You can use Form 8818 to record this information. You should also keep bills, receipts, canceled checks, or other documentation that shows you paid qualified higher educational expenses during the year."

Taxation of interest. Interest income from Treasury bills, notes, and bonds is subject to federal income tax but is exempt from all state and local income taxes. You should receive Form 1099-INT showing the interest (in box 3) paid to you for the year. Payments of principal and interest generally will be credited to your designated checking or savings account by direct deposit through the TreasuryDirect® system. Treasury bills. These bills generally have a 4-week, 13-week, 26-week, or 52-week maturity period. They are generally issued at a discount in the amount of $100 and multiples of $100. The difference between the discounted price you pay for the bills and the face value you receive at maturity is interest income. Generally, you report this interest income when the bill is paid at maturity. If you paid a premium for a bill (more than the face value), you generally report the premium as a Section 171 deduction when the bill is paid at maturity. Treasury notes and bonds. Treasury notes have maturity periods of more than 1 year, ranging up to 10 years. Maturity periods for Treasury bonds are longer than 10 years. Both generally are issued in denominations of $100 to $1 million and generally pay interest every 6 months. Generally, you report this interest for the year paid.

247,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,"U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds",EY,EXPLANATION,"The paragraph above discusses interest income only when a Treasury bill is held until maturity. When a Treasury bill is sold before maturity, the difference between the purchase price and the selling price may be part interest and part short-term capital gain or loss. Example You buy a $10,000 Treasury bill for $9,760 exactly 100 days before maturity. Thirty days later, you sell the bill for $9,850. For tax purposes, you have earned a pro rata portion of the discount as interest income for the time you held the bill: 30/100 × ($10,000 − $9,760) = $72. The other $18 you receive over and above the purchase price is a short-term capital gain."
248,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,"U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds",EY,TAXSAVER,"U.S. Treasury bills are relatively short-term investments. Their maturity dates vary from a few days to 26 weeks. Since the interest income in most cases is reported at maturity (unless the bill is sold beforehand), purchasing Treasury bills with a maturity date falling in the following year offers cash basis taxpayers an opportunity to postpone interest income from one year to the next. However, if you borrow money to acquire Treasury bills, your interest expense deduction may also be deferred. See chapter 24, Interest expense, for an explanation."
249,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Bonds Sold Between Interest Dates,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you sell a bond between interest payment dates, part of the sales price represents interest accrued to the date of sale. You must report that part of the sales price as interest income for the year of sale. If you buy a bond between interest payment dates, part of the purchase price represents interest accrued before the date of purchase. When that interest is paid to you, treat it as a nontaxable return of your capital investment, rather than as interest income. See Accrued interest on bonds under How To Report Interest Income in chapter 1 of Publication 550 for information on reporting the payment."
250,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Bonds Sold Between Interest Dates,EY,EXPLANATION,"Usually, interest on a bond is paid every 6 months. When a bond is sold between interest payment dates, the seller is entitled to payment from the buyer for the interest earned since the issuer's last interest payment, in addition to payment for the bond itself. This extra payment—often called “purchased interest” on a broker's statement—is interest income to the seller of the bond, reportable for tax purposes as of the date of the sale. The buyer of the bond should record the purchased interest separately from the price of the bond in his or her records. The purchased interest partially offsets the first interest payment made to the buyer. If the purchased interest is paid in 2016 but the first interest payment is not received until 2017, the buyer should report the purchased interest as an adjustment to interest income in 2017, not in 2016. Example 1 On April 1, 2016, Cindy bought from Michelle a $10,000 bond yielding 10%. Interest on the bond is paid on January 1 and July 1 of each year. Cindy paid $10,250, representing $10,000 in principal plus $250 for interest earned from January 1 to April 1. Thus, Michelle received $250 of interest income on April 1, 2016. Cindy received her first interest check on July 1, 2016. Half of the $500 Cindy received on July 1 represented a payment of purchased interest, and the other half represented interest income. In order to avoid any IRS matching notices, Cindy should report the full $500 on Schedule B (Form 1040 or Form 1040A) and also show a subtraction for $250 of interest that she purchased. Example 2 Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that Cindy bought the bond from Michelle on October 1, 2016. Cindy received her interest check for $500 on January 1, 2017. Half of it represented repayment of purchased interest, and the other half represented interest income. However, Cindy may not deduct the $250 of purchased interest in 2016, but must wait until 2017. On the other hand, Michelle will report $250 of interest income on her 2016 return, since she received it on October 1, 2016."
251,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Insurance,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Life insurance proceeds paid to you as beneficiary of the insured person are usually not taxable. But if you receive the proceeds in installments, you must usually report a part of each installment payment as interest income. For more information about insurance proceeds received in installments, see Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income."
252,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Insurance,EY,EXPLANATION,"For more information on life insurance proceeds, see chapter 12, Other income."
253,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Insurance,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Annuity. If you buy an annuity with life insurance proceeds, the annuity payments you receive are taxed as pension and annuity income from a nonqualified plan, not as interest income. See chapter 10 for information on pension and annuity income from nonqualified plans."
254,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,State or Local Government Obligations,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Interest on a bond used to finance government operations generally is not taxable if the bond is issued by a state, the District of Columbia, a possession of the United States, or any of their political subdivisions. Bonds issued after 1982 (including tribal economic development bonds issued after February 17, 2009) by an Indian tribal government are treated as issued by a state. Interest on these bonds is generally tax exempt if the bonds are part of an issue of which substantially all proceeds are to be used in the exercise of any essential government function."
255,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,State or Local Government Obligations,EY,EXPLANATION,"While the interest accrued on municipal bonds is generally tax-exempt for federal income tax purposes, any accretion of gain recognized on the bond's sale or upon the maturity of a bond purchased at a market discount is subject to tax as interest up to the amount of the market discount. The balance is taxed as capital gain. To illustrate, assume that tax-exempt municipal bonds were previously sold to the public at par (face value) at an interest rate lower than the rate demanded by today's investors. Since the interest rate on these bonds is lower than the rate demanded by today's investors, the bonds are trading in the marketplace at a substantial discount from par. This is a market discount. If you buy these bonds now and subsequently realize a gain either when you sell them or when they reach maturity, you must report the gain as taxable interest income up to the amount of the bonds’ accrued market discount and the remaining portion as capital gain if the bond was a capital asset. Similarly, if you realize a capital loss on municipal bonds, it is deductible. The rule with regard to bonds bought at a premium is different. If you buy a bond for $11,000 that will mature for $10,000 and you hold it until maturity, you may not claim a capital loss or any kind of deduction because the tax law requires that you amortize the premium over the life of the bond. The annual amortization of the premium is deducted from the cost basis of the bond so that at the bond's maturity date, its cost basis is equal to the proceeds received."
256,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,State or Local Government Obligations,EY,TAXSAVER,"If you are considering selling a tax-exempt bond and purchasing another tax-exempt bond, keep in mind that for bonds purchased before May 1, 1993, you will not have to treat accrued market discount as ordinary income, but rather as a capital gain. Depending on your tax bracket, this may be a significant consideration, since currently the top capital gains tax rate is 20%, while the top marginal rate is 39.6%. When considering the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax, these tax rates become 23.8% and 43.4% respectively. Further, while most municipal bond interest is not subject to federal tax, capital gain income and accretion of market discount are. You should take these differences into account when you are deciding which bonds to buy. Example A $10,000, 10-year tax-exempt municipal bond, yielding 8% purchased at par, will provide $800 of tax-free interest each year, and there will be no capital gain on maturity. The total earned for the 10 years is $8,000. Similarly, a $12,000, 10-year tax-exempt municipal bond with a 5.2% coupon ($624 interest per year) purchased on May 1, 2005, at $10,000 will yield a total of $8,240 over the life of the bond: $624 of tax-free interest each year plus $200 of taxable interest income each year if the bond is held to maturity. The $200 represents the annual market discount accretion. But the taxable interest income will be subject to tax of up to 43.4%, so the net earnings for the 10 years may be reduced to $7,108."

260,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Original Issue Discount (OID),TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Original issue discount (OID) is a form of interest. You generally include OID in your income as it accrues over the term of the debt instrument, whether or not you receive any payments from the issuer. A debt instrument generally has OID when the instrument is issued for a price that is less than its stated redemption price at maturity. OID is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price. All debt instruments that pay no interest before maturity are presumed to be issued at a discount. Zero coupon bonds are one example of these instruments. The OID accrual rules generally do not apply to short-term obligations (those with a fixed maturity date of 1 year or less from date of issue). See Discount on Short-Term Obligations in chapter 1 of Publication 550. De minimis OID. You can treat the discount as zero if it is less than one-fourth of 1% (.0025) of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of full years from the date of original issue to maturity. This small discount is known as “de minimis” OID. Example 1. You bought a 10-year bond with a stated redemption price at maturity of $1,000, issued at $980 with OID of $20. One-fourth of 1% of $1,000 (stated redemption price) times 10 (the number of full years from the date of original issue to maturity) equals $25. Because the $20 discount is less than $25, the OID is treated as zero. (If you hold the bond at maturity, you will recognize $20 [$1,000–$980] of capital gain.) Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the bond was issued at $950. The OID is $50. Because the $50 discount is more than the $25 figured in Example 1, you must include the OID in income as it accrues over the term of the bond. Debt instrument bought after original issue. If you buy a debt instrument with de minimis OID at a premium, the discount is not includible in income. If you buy a debt instrument with de minimis OID at a discount, the discount is reported under the market discount rules. See Market Discount Bonds in chapter 1 of Publication 550. Exceptions to reporting OID as current income. The OID rules discussed in this chapter do not apply to the following debt instruments. 1.    Tax-exempt obligations. (However, see Stripped tax-exempt obligations under Stripped Bonds and Coupons in chapter 1 of Publication 550). 2.    U.S. savings bonds. 3.    Short-term debt instruments (those with a fixed maturity date of not more than 1 year from the date of issue). 4.    Obligations issued by an individual before March 2, 1984. 5.    Loans between individuals if all the following are true. a. The lender is not in the business of lending money. b. The amount of the loan, plus the amount of any outstanding prior loans between the same individuals, is $10,000 or less. c. Avoiding any federal tax is not one of the principal purposes of the loan."
261,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Original Issue Discount (OID),EY,EXPLANATION,"The IRS interpretation is misleading with respect to tax exempt obligations issued after September 3, 1982, and acquired after March 1, 1984. Even though interest on such obligations is tax free, the OID rules will apply in determining the basis of the security in the event of sale, exchange, or maturity. (See the discussion later in this chapter.) In addition, the original issue discount on a stripped tax exempt bond may be treated as taxable interest if the stripped bond is sold at a discount rate that is higher than the original issue."
262,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Original Issue Discount (OID),TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Form 1099-OID. The issuer of the debt instrument (or your broker if you held the instrument through a broker) should give you Form 1099-OID, or a similar statement, if the total OID for the calendar year is $10 or more. Form 1099-OID will show, in box  1, the amount of OID for the part of the year that you held the bond. It also will show, in box  2, the stated interest you must include in your income.

263,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Original Issue Discount (OID),EY,EXPLANATION,"Stripped coupon bonds are coupon bonds that have been separated into component parts. The coupons represent claims for interest payments, which are paid on a periodic basis. The bond itself represents the claim for the repayment of the principal, which occurs at some future time. Example A 10-year $10,000, 9% bond (interest paid semiannually) was issued on January 1, 2016, for $10,000. On April 1, 2016, when the bond had a market price of $9,900, the coupons were stripped from the bond so that they and the bond became separate assets that could be bought and sold in the marketplace. In other words, the holder could have sold the right to receive $450 semiannually for the next 9¾ years and could have independently sold the right to receive the $10,000 on January 1, 2026. Assume that the right to receive 20 semiannual payments is worth $4,100 and the right to receive $10,000 on January 1, 2026, is worth $5,800. The tax treatment to buyer and to seller is as follows: The seller: 1. Include the accrued interest income of $225 from January 1, 2016, through April 1, 2016, in income. 2. Increase your basis by the $225 to $10,225. 3. Allocate the basis, using fair market value, to the coupons [($4,100 ÷ $9,900) × $10,225 = $4,235] and the bond [($5,800 ÷ $9,900) × $10,225 = $5,990]. 4. Compare the proceeds for what you sell–either the coupons or the bond–with the basis figured above to determine if you've had a gain or a loss. 5. The difference between the basis of what is not sold and the amount that will be received over time is considered an original issue discount (OID). That amount is treated as earned over the life of the asset. Thus, if the coupons were retained, the difference between their basis ($4,235) and the amount that will be received over time ($450 semiannually for 10 years, or $9,000) would be the original issue discount. In this example, $4,765 in interest income must be included on your returns over the 10 years. The amount to be included in your income for each year is figured by performing a complicated computation, for which you will probably require professional assistance. Similarly, if the bond were retained, the difference between its basis ($5,990) and the proceeds ($10,000) would be its original issue discount. Again, complicated computations are required to determine the amount included in your income each year. The buyer: The difference between what you pay and what you will receive over time is the original issue discount. A special computation is necessary to figure how much you should include in income each year."

If you disposed of a debt instrument or acquired it from another holder during the year, see Bonds Sold Between Interest Dates, earlier, for information about the treatment of periodic interest that may be shown in box 2 of Form 1099-OID for that instrument."
265,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Original Issue Discount (OID),EY,EXPLANATION,"These rules also apply to debt instruments issued by individuals after March 1, 1984. This will affect individuals who borrow and lend at a discounted rate. The current law also makes original issue discount the general rule with regard to obligations issued after July 18, 1984, and purchased in the open market. (This law also applies to bonds issued before July 19, 1984, and purchased after April 30, 1993.) If you sell property after December 31, 1984, or buy a bond in the marketplace that was issued after July 18, 1984, or a bond issued prior to July 19, 1984, and purchased after April 30, 1993, you must determine whether there is original issue discount and, if so, how much. Some of that amount will be included in your ordinary income each year. You will likely need professional help to make this calculation. For more information, see Market discount bonds, later in this chapter. Example Assume that Jorge purchases a publicly traded 6% $1 million bond that was issued after December 31, 1984, for $900,000. The bond has a maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase. Jorge will also receive $60,000 in interest each year.

268,Chapter 7,Interest income,Taxable Interest,Original Issue Discount (OID),EY,TAXPLANNER,"A zero-coupon bond is one that is purchased at a substantial discount and pays no interest during its life. If you buy a zero-coupon bond, you do not bear the investment risk entailed in reinvesting interest payments received over the life of the bond because there are no such payments. Moreover, since the issue price and the maturity value have been derived from compound interest tables, you may figure what the precise return on your investment will be if the bond is held until it matures. This is true only of zero-coupon bonds. Note: Because you do not receive the interest until a zero-coupon bond matures, the market value of the bond during the holding period can be very volatile as market interest rates change. The longer the maturity is, the more volatile is the price. Even though the interest on a zero-coupon bond is not paid until maturity, it is included in income each year. Consequently, an individual must pay tax on income that he or she has not yet received. However, if the bonds are owned in your IRA or Keogh plan, this income is not currently taxable. (See chapter 17, Individual retirement arrangements [IRAs].) The advantage, however, is that you lock in an interest rate. On the other hand, nontaxable zero-coupon bonds, such as zero-coupon municipal bonds, may be attractive to individuals in a high tax bracket for the obvious reasons that interest rates are locked in and the increase in value each year is not taxable. In this case, you increase your cost basis on the bonds each year by the amount of the original issue discount applicable to that year, even though you don't pay any federal tax on the income. You may, however, have to pay state income taxes. You will need to check your state tax rules. Avoid holding municipal bonds in your IRA or Keogh plan as all distributions from the account, including the interest earned on the bonds, will be treated as federal and state taxable income when you make a withdrawal from your account and will be taxed at ordinary income rates. Example 1 Assume that Jennifer purchases a 10-year $100,000, nontaxable zero-coupon bond on June 30, 2016, for $50,000. The chart below illustrates how the basis of the bond increases over the life of the bond."

If you buy a bond on the secondary market, it may have market discount. If you dispose of a market discount bond, you generally must recognize the gain as taxable interest income up to the amount of the bond's accrued market discount, if: 1. The bond was issued after July 18, 1984, or 2. You purchased the bond after April 30, 1993. The rest of the gain is capital gain if the bond was a capital asset."

276,Chapter 7,Interest income,When To Report Interest Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"When to report your interest income depends on whether you use the cash method or an accrual method to report income. Cash method. Most individual taxpayers use the cash method. If you use this method, you generally report your interest income in the year in which you actually or constructively receive it. However, there are special rules for reporting the discount on certain debt instruments. See U.S. Savings Bonds and Original Issue Discount (OID), earlier. Example. On September 1, 2014, you loaned another individual $2,000 at 12%, compounded annually. You are not in the business of lending money. The note stated that principal and interest would be due on August 31, 2016. In 2016, you received $2,508.80 ($2,000 principal and $508.80 interest). If you use the cash method, you must include in income on your 2016 return the $508.80 interest you received in that year. Constructive receipt. You constructively receive income when it is credited to your account or made available to you. You do not need to have physical possession of it. For example, you are considered to receive interest, dividends, or other earnings on any deposit or account in a bank, savings and loan, or similar financial institution, or interest on life insurance policy dividends left to accumulate, when they are credited to your account and subject to your withdrawal. This is true even if they are not yet entered in your passbook. You constructively receive income on the deposit or account even if you must: §  Make withdrawals in multiples of even amounts, §  Give a notice to withdraw before making the withdrawal, §  Withdraw all or part of the account to withdraw the earnings, or §  Pay a penalty on early withdrawals, unless the interest you are to receive on an early withdrawal or redemption is substantially less than the interest payable at maturity. Accrual method. If you use an accrual method, you report your interest income when you earn it, whether or not you have received it. Interest is earned over the term of the debt instrument. Example. If, in the previous example, you use an accrual method, you must include the interest in your income as you earn it. You would report the interest as follows: 2014, $80; 2015, $249.60; and 2016, $179.20. Coupon bonds. Interest on bearer bonds with detachable coupons is generally taxable in the year the coupon becomes due and payable. It does not matter when you mail the coupon for payment."

285,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,,,EY,Introduction,"Most people think they know what dividends are. The problem is that the term is commonly used to describe a large number of items that the IRS does not consider to be dividends. “Dividends” paid by an insurance company to its policyholders are considered by the IRS to be a return of premiums, not dividends. “Dividends” paid by a savings and loan association to its depositors are considered to be interest, not dividends. So what is a dividend? A dividend is a share of a corporation's profits that is distributed to shareholders. This chapter discusses how these distributions, as well as other corporate distributions, are taxed. If you own stock in a company or shares in a mutual fund or real estate investment trust (REIT), you may receive dividend distributions. The distributing company or mutual fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV just after year-end with the total amount of dividends you must report to the IRS on your income tax return. This chapter explains the difference between the various tax forms you may receive and which forms to keep in your records or attach to your income tax return. This chapter also discusses dividend reinvestment plans (DRPs) that reinvest the dividends in the stock generating them. These plans are provided by companies for all their shareholders and should not be confused with retirement plans run by employers for the benefit of their employees. Certain dividend income (but not interest income), referred to as “qualified dividend income,” is taxed at a maximum rate of 20% for high income taxpayers who are otherwise in the 39.6% regular income tax bracket (i.e., taxable incomes over $415,050 for individual filers, $441,000 for heads of households, $466,950 married filing jointly, and $233,475 if married filing separately). Qualified dividends received by taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets are taxed at a zero rate. For all others, the tax rate on qualified is 15%. These preferential tax rates on qualified dividend income apply to both the regular tax and the alternative minimum tax. Under the Affordable Care Act, the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) on unearned income—including dividends—took effect for tax years beginning in 2013 and thereafter. For individuals, the tax is 3.8% of the lesser of: (1) “net investment income” or (2) the excess of modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $200,000 ($250,000 if married filing jointly or a qualifying widow(er) with dependent child; $125,000 if married filing separately). The NIIT is payable regardless of whether or not you otherwise pay any regular income tax or are subject to alternative minimum tax on your income."
286,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,,,EY,Tax Breaks and Deductions You Can Use Checklist,"Qualified dividend income. Taxpayers in the highest regular tax bracket of 39.6% are subject to a maximum tax rate of 20% on qualified dividend income. On the other hand, taxpayers who are in the 10% and 15% tax brackets have a 0% tax rate applied to qualified dividend income. For taxpayers in the other regular tax brackets, the top rate on qualified dividends is 15%. (The top tax rates on long-term capital gains are the same as those for qualified dividends. See chapter 16, Reporting gains and losses, for more information.) The twist is that not all dividend income is “qualified,” so look carefully before you invest. For example, most income from money market funds is not qualified dividend income. Dividends from foreign corporations, on the other hand, may be qualified. Foreign dividends. If you received dividends on foreign corporation stock that you own, it's likely that the corporation withheld foreign tax on those payments. Don't report the net amount on your tax return. Instead, you should report the full amount of the dividend (before withholding) and claim the foreign tax withheld either as a credit or as a deduction on your return. See chapter 23, Taxes you may deduct, and chapter 38, Other credits including the earned income credit. Life insurance dividends. “Dividends” paid out on life insurance policies are not taxable income. They are actually considered to be a return of your premiums. You should not report them on your return unless the total is more than your accumulated premiums. Dividends used to buy more stock. If you invest in stock and choose to have the dividends reinvested to purchase additional stock, your basis in the stock is increased by the amount of dividends reinvested. The dividends are taxable to you even though you did not receive the cash, but the basis of your stock is increased by the amount of the dividends reinvested. When the stock is sold, don't forget to increase your basis by the amount of the dividends reinvested."
287,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Reminder,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Foreign-source income. If you are a U.S. citizen with dividend income from sources outside the United States (foreign-source income), you must report that income on your tax return unless it is exempt by U.S. law. This is true whether you reside inside or outside the United States and whether or not you receive a Form 1099 from the foreign payer."
288,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Reminder,,EY,TAXSAVER,"Foreign dividends. Foreign governments often withhold tax on dividends from foreign corporations before you receive them. For example, if you are a stockholder in a Canadian company that declares a $100 dividend, you might receive only $85 because of a $15 Canadian withholding tax. Nevertheless, the $100 must be reported on your U.S. income tax return. The $15 of foreign taxes may be claimed either as a foreign tax credit using Form 1116 or as an itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040). It is generally preferable to take the tax credit. For more on this subject, see chapter 23, Taxes you may deduct, and chapter 38, Other credits including the earned income credit."
289,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Reminder,,EY,TAXSAVER,"Individuals with $300 or less of foreign taxes paid ($600 for joint filers) are able to take a foreign tax credit for that entire amount. This is an exemption from the limitation of offsetting foreign tax credits against U.S. tax liability, which applies to taxes paid in excess of $300 ($600 married filing jointly). The exemption must be elected each year and is only available if all foreign source income is qualified passive income. Example You are a single individual who invests in a mutual fund that holds foreign securities. During 2016, your share of foreign taxes paid by this mutual fund is $250. When you prepare your 2016 tax return, you can claim an exemption from the foreign tax credit limitation and credit the full $250 against your U.S. tax liability."
290,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Reminder,,EY,TAXALERT,"Dividends paid on foreign corporation stocks that are readily tradable on U.S. securities markets are eligible for the preferential federal tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a share will be treated as so traded if an American Depository Receipt (ADR) backed by such a share is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. Moreover, dividends from corporations incorporated in a U.S. possession, or those eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States, are generally eligible for the lower rate. Dividends paid by foreign personal holding companies, foreign investment companies, and passive foreign investment companies do not qualify for the reduced tax rates."
291,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Reminder,,EY,TAXALERT,"Dividends received by an individual shareholder from domestic corporations and “qualified foreign corporations” are eligible for the same reduced federal tax rate as net capital gain income. These reduced rates apply for both the regular tax and the alternative minimum tax. Thus, these dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 20% for taxpayers who are in the top 39.6% tax bracket (i.e., taxable incomes over $415,050 for individual filers, $441,000 for heads of households, $466,950 married filing jointly, and $233,475 if married filing separately). Qualified dividends received by taxpayers subject to tax brackets of 15% or lower are taxed at 0%. Qualified dividends received by taxpayers in the other regular income tax brackets (i.e., 25%, 28%, 33%, or 35%) are taxed at 15%. This reduced tax rate only applies to dividends from common shares held for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend period. (The ex-dividend date is the date that determines whether the seller, rather than the buyer, receives the announced dividend.) Hence, this provision combined with the 20% top rate on long-term capital gains makes short-term investing less tax-efficient. Example You purchase dividend-paying common stock on February 1 and sell it November 1. The company declares dividends on March 31, June 30, and September 30. The lower tax rates apply to all dividends because you held the stock for more than 60 days out of the 121-day period that began 60 days in advance of each ex-dividend date. If you purchase stock on March 1 and sell it on April 15, a March 31 dividend would not qualify for the lower tax rates because you did not hold it for more than 60 days."
292,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Reminder,,EY,TAXALERT,"Regardless of whether dividends you receive are qualified dividends that are taxed at the lower 0%, 15%, or 20% preferential tax rates or are ordinary dividends subject to the higher regular income tax rates that apply to ordinary income, under the Affordable Care Act, dividends, along with certain other investment income, are subject to the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) that took effect for tax years beginning in 2013. For individuals, the tax is 3.8% of the lesser of: (1) “net investment income” or (2) the excess of modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $200,000 ($250,000 if married filing jointly or a qualifying widow(er) with dependent child; $125,000 if married filing separately). These threshold dollar amounts are not indexed each year for inflation. Net investment income subject to the NIIT is defined as investment income reduced by allocable deductions.

This chapter also explains how to report dividend income on your tax return. Dividends are distributions of money, stock, or other property paid to you by a corporation or by a mutual fund. You also may receive dividends through a partnership, an estate, a trust, or an association that is taxed as a corporation. However, some amounts you receive that are called dividends are actually interest income. (See Dividends that are actually interest in chapter 7.)"
295,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Reminder,,EY,EXPLANATION,"There are generally two different types of corporations: S corporations and C corporations. The treatment of distributions from S corporations to shareholders differs from that of C corporations to their shareholders. In this chapter, the IRS is referring to C corporations only, because S corporations do not technically pay dividends. See chapter 12, Other income, for information on distributions from S corporations."
296,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Reminder,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Most distributions are paid in cash (or check). However, distributions can consist of more stock, stock rights, other property, or services."
297,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Reminder,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Any distribution to a shareholder from earnings and profits is generally a dividend. However, a distribution is not a taxable dividend if it is a return of capital to the shareholder. Most distributions are in the form of money, but they may also be in stock or other property. An interest-free loan or below-market rate loan by a corporation to a stockholder may result in taxable dividend income to the stockholder. Additionally, if you are a stockholder who uses company property for personal use, you are considered to be in constructive receipt of a dividend that will be taxable to you and disallowed as a tax deduction to the company. The value of a constructive dividend is the fair market value of the benefit provided to the shareholder. Example 1 A shareholder's use of a condominium maintained by his solely owned corporation resulted in his receipt of constructive dividends because he maintained the unit as his residence. The taxpayer benefited from the corporation's payments because he did not have to pay any housing costs. The Tax Court determined the portion of the condominium expenses that was allocable to business use and permitted the corporation to deduct that amount. The balance of the expenses was treated as constructive dividends received by the shareholder. Example 2 A corporation sold real property to its sole shareholder at a price lower than the property's fair market value. The result is a constructive dividend to the shareholder of the difference between the fair market value and the purchase price, and is treated as a gain for the corporation."
298,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Reminder,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"All personal loans from corporations should have written documentation and charge market interest rates. If the corporation does not charge appropriate interest on the personal loans, and if the corporation has sufficient earnings and profits, the unpaid interest will be treated as a constructive dividend of ordinary income to the borrower (individual taxpayer). Failure to correctly report this transaction may subject the borrower to penalties and interest on the underpaid tax."

301,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,General Information,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"This section discusses general rules for dividend income. Tax on unearned income of certain children. Part of a child's 2016 unearned income may be taxed at the parent's tax rate. If it is, Form 8615, Tax for Certain Children Who Have Unearned Income, must be completed and attached to the child's tax return. If not, Form 8615 is not required and the child's income is taxed at his or her own tax rate. Some parents can choose to include the child's interest and dividends on the parent's return if certain requirements are met. Use Form 8814, Parents’ Election To Report Child's Interest and Dividends, for this purpose. For more information about the tax on unearned income of children and the parents’ election, see chapter 32."
302,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,General Information,,EY,TAXALERT,"The rules for taxing a child's investment income at their parent's rate are commonly known as the “kiddie tax” rules. Form 8615, Tax for Certain Children Who Have Unearned Income, is required to figure the tax for a child with investment income of more than $2,100 if the child: 1. Was under age 18 at the end of 2016, 2. Was age 18 at the end of 2016 and did not have earned income that was more than half of the child's support, or 3. Was a full-time student over age 18 and under age 24 at the end of 2016 and did not have earned income that was more than half of the child's support. Children whose earned income exceeds one-half of the amount of the support they receive are not subject to the kiddie tax under this provision. The election to report a child's investment income on a parent's return and the special rule for when a child must file Form 6251, Alternative Minimum Tax—Individuals, also applies to the children listed above. For more information, see chapter 32, Tax on investment income of certain children."
303,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,General Information,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"To avoid paying the “kiddie tax,” you should consider investments for your child that generate little or no taxable income until your child “grows out” of the reach of the kiddie tax. Explanation A parent may elect on Form 8814, Parent's Election to Report Child's Interest and Dividends, to include on his or her return the unearned income of a child under the age of 19 whose income is less than $10,500 in 2016 and consists solely of interest, dividends, or Alaska Permanent Fund dividends. The election cannot be made if estimated payments were made in your child's name, if your child had an overpayment on his or her 2015 tax return which was applied to 2016, or if your child is subject to backup withholding. (See explanation of backup withholding, later.) The election must be made by the due date (including extensions) of the parent's tax return. A separate election must be made for each child whose income the parents choose to report. If a child (under age 19) had income in 2016 over $2,100, it would be taxed on Form 8814 as follows: the first $1,050 would be tax-free, the next $1,050 would be taxed at 10% (0% for qualified dividends), and the amount of income over $2,100 would be taxed at the parent's tax rate. If the child files his own return, the child is required to attach Form 8615 to his or her return, which can be complicated if there is more than one child under age 19 required to file a return."
304,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,General Information,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Amounts of Net Investment Income that are included on your own tax return by reason of Form 8814 are included in calculating the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) that you may owe. If you may be subject to the NIIT and have children subject to the “kiddie tax,” you may consider having your children file their own tax returns to report their unearned income thereby reducing the amount of Net Investment Income potentially subject to the NIIT."

Backup withholding. Your dividend income is generally not subject to regular withholding. However, it may be subject to backup withholding to ensure that income tax is collected on the income. Under backup withholding, the payer of dividends must withhold, as income tax, on the amount you are paid, applying the appropriate withholding rate. Backup withholding may also be required if the IRS has determined that you underreported your interest or dividend income. For more information, see Backup Withholding in chapter 4. Stock certificate in two or more names. If two or more persons hold stock as joint tenants, tenants by the entirety, or tenants in common, each person's share of any dividends from the stock is determined by local law."
308,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,General Information,,EY,EXPLANATION,"There are many technical problems if stock is jointly registered in two or more names. You should not assume that any income earned is earned jointly. Rather, in cases where no immediate gift transfer of the property is intended, the income should be reported by the owner of the property producing the income. (See Joint Accounts in chapter 7, Interest income, for a complete discussion of this matter.)"
309,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,General Information,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Because only one recipient's social security number will be recorded by the corporation paying the dividend, the IRS's document-matching program may issue deficiency notices when the income is split between two or more individuals’ returns. This situation arises because the income tax return with the social security number shown on the company's records may not include the full amount of the dividend paid. To reduce the chance of receiving an IRS deficiency notice, show both the full amount of the dividend paid and a subtraction for “amount attributable to others” on Schedule B (Form 1040 or Form 1040A) in the section used for reporting dividends. The person who receives the other part of the dividend need not worry. Although that person includes on his or her return an amount for which he or she does not receive a Form 1099-DIV, the IRS rarely questions returns when income in excess of that computed by the government is reported. (See the discussion regarding Nominees later in this chapter and Joint Accounts in chapter 7, Interest income, for a further discussion of this matter.)"

314,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,General Information,,EY,EXPLANATION,"A nominee is someone who, in his or her name and with his or her social security or federal identification number, receives income that belongs to another person. Form 1099 is used by the nominee to report the amount and type of income received on behalf of the owner. If you receive a Form 1099 from a nominee, you should cite the source of that income on your tax return as the nominee, not the original payer of the income. If you receive a Form 1099 as a nominee for another person, see the section on Nominees under How to Report Dividend Income, toward the end of this chapter, for a complete discussion on the filing and reporting requirements of a nominee.

You report the dividend in the year it was declared."
320,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,General Information,,EY,TAXSAVER,"You should pay close attention to the timing of your purchase of a mutual fund. For example, if you invest in a fund near the end of the year and the fund shortly thereafter makes a year-end distribution, you will have to pay tax on the distribution even though from your point of view you are simply getting back the capital you just invested in the fund. In effect, all you've done is “bought” taxable income that the fund earned earlier in the year but had not yet paid out to shareholders. Typically, the fund's share price drops by the amount of the distribution. However, your cost basis in the mutual fund will be the pre-distribution price you paid for the shares. There is one consolation: Your higher basis will reduce any capital gain on a later sale, or if you sell the fund at a loss, it will increase your capital loss. If you want to limit your tax liability and lower your basis in the shares, you should delay your purchase of fund shares until after the record date for the distribution. Usually a fund can tell you when distributions, if any, for the year are expected. Alternatively, you can consult investment publications or websites, which indicate distribution dates for the previous year. They are usually a pretty good guide to future distribution dates. Example ABC Fund declares and distributes a $1 dividend on October 1. If you purchased 1,000 shares at $10 per share on September 30, you will have to report $1,000 of income for 2016. If you bought the shares on October 2, after the record date, you will pay $9 per share and have no taxable income to report. Of course, for the shares bought on September 30, your basis would be $10 per share instead of $9."
321,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,General Information,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"If you are thinking of selling shares in a mutual fund, particularly near the end of the year when many funds pay dividends, you should consider redeeming your shares before any upcoming dividend payments are made by the fund. If your shares are worth more than you paid, you can maximize your capital gains on the redemption and avoid paying the higher tax rate due if the dividend is not a qualified dividend. (A dividend generally will qualify for the reduced preferential tax rate if you own the underlying common stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the “ex-dividend date,” the day on which the stock starts trading without its next dividend.) If your shares are worth less than you paid for them, you can minimize your capital losses by selling before the dividend. Remember, the net asset value per share of the fund (that is, the amount you would receive on the redemption of your shares) decreases by the amount of the dividend. For more about mutual funds, see chapter 40, Mutual funds."
322,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,Ordinary (taxable) dividends are the most common type of distribution from a corporation or a mutual fund. They are paid out of earnings and profits and are ordinary income to you. This means they are not capital gains. You can assume that any dividend you receive on common or preferred stock is an ordinary dividend unless the paying corporation or mutual fund tells you otherwise. Ordinary dividends will be shown in box 1a of the Form 1099-DIV you receive.
323,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,Qualified Dividends,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Qualified dividends are the ordinary dividends subject to the same 0%, 15%, or 20% maximum tax rate that applies to net capital gain. They should be shown in box  1b of the Form 1099-DIV you receive. The maximum rate of tax on qualified dividends is: §  0% on any amount that otherwise would be taxed at a 10% or 15% rate. §  15% on any amount that otherwise would be taxed at rates greater than 15% but less than 39.6%. §  20% on any amount that otherwise would be taxed at a 39.6% rate. To qualify for the maximum rate, all of the following requirements must be met. §  The dividends must have been paid by a U.S. corporation or a qualified foreign corporation. (See Qualified foreign corporation, later.) §  The dividends are not of the type listed later under Dividends that are not qualified dividends. §  You meet the holding period (discussed next). Holding period. You must have held the stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The ex-dividend date is the first date following the declaration of a dividend on which the buyer of a stock is not entitled to receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller will get the dividend. When counting the number of days you held the stock, include the day you disposed of the stock, but not the day you acquired it. See the examples later. Exception for preferred stock. In the case of preferred stock, you must have held the stock more than 90 days during the 181-day period that begins 90 days before the ex-dividend date if the dividends are due to periods totaling more than 366 days. If the preferred dividends are due to periods totaling less than 367 days, the holding period in the previous paragraph applies. Example 1. You bought 5,000 shares of XYZ Corp. common stock on July 8, 2016. XYZ Corp. paid a cash dividend of 10 cents per share. The ex-dividend date was July 15, 2016. Your Form 1099-DIV from XYZ Corp. shows $500 in box 1a (ordinary dividends) and in box 1b (qualified dividends). However, you sold the 5,000 shares on August 11, 2016. You held your shares of XYZ Corp. for only 34 days of the 121-day period (from July 9, 2016, through August 11, 2016). The 121-day period began on May 16, 2016 (60 days before the ex-dividend date), and ended on September 13, 2016. You have no qualified dividends from XYZ Corp. because you held the XYZ stock for less than 61 days. Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that you bought the stock on July 14, 2016 (the day before the ex-dividend date), and you sold the stock on September 15, 2016. You held the stock for 63 days (from July 15, 2016, through September 15, 2016). The $500 of qualified dividends shown in box 1b of your Form 1099-DIV are all qualified dividends because you held the stock for 61 days of the 121-day period (from July 15, 2016, through September 13, 2016). Example 3. You bought 10,000 shares of ABC Mutual Fund common stock on July 8, 2016. ABC Mutual Fund paid a cash dividend of 10 cents a share. The ex-dividend date was July 15, 2016. The ABC Mutual Fund advises you that the portion of the dividend eligible to be treated as qualified dividends equals 2 cents per share. Your Form 1099-DIV from ABC Mutual Fund shows total ordinary dividends of $1,000 and qualified dividends of $200. However, you sold the 10,000 shares on August 11, 2016. You have no qualified dividends from ABC Mutual Fund because you held the ABC Mutual Fund stock for less than 61 days. Holding period reduced where risk of loss is diminished. When determining whether you met the minimum holding period discussed earlier, you cannot count any day during which you meet any of the following conditions. 1.    You had an option to sell, were under a contractual obligation to sell, or had made (and not closed) a short sale of substantially identical stock or securities. 2.    You were grantor (writer) of an option to buy substantially identical stock or securities. 3.    Your risk of loss is diminished by holding one or more other positions in substantially similar or related property. For information about how to apply condition (3), see Regulations section 1.246-5. Qualified foreign corporation. A foreign corporation is a qualified foreign corporation if it meets any of the following conditions. 1.    The corporation is incorporated in a U.S. possession. 2.    The corporation is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that the Treasury Department determines is satisfactory for this purpose and that includes an exchange of information program. For a list of those treaties, see Table 8-1. 3.    The corporation does not meet (1) or (2) above, but the stock for which the dividend is paid is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States.

A corporation is not a qualified foreign corporation if it is a passive foreign investment company during its tax year in which the dividends are paid or during its previous tax year. Readily tradable stock. Any stock (such as common, ordinary, or preferred) or an American depositary receipt in respect of that stock is considered to satisfy requirement (3) under Qualified foreign corporation, if it is listed on a national securities exchange that is registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or on the Nasdaq Stock Market. For a list of the exchanges that meet these requirements, see www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrexchanges.shtml. Dividends that are not qualified dividends.

326,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,Dividends Used to Buy More Stock,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"The corporation in which you own stock may have a dividend reinvestment plan. This plan lets you choose to use your dividends to buy (through an agent) more shares of stock in the corporation instead of receiving the dividends in cash. Most mutual funds also permit shareholders to automatically reinvest distributions in more shares in the fund, instead of receiving cash. If you use your dividends to buy more stock at a price equal to its fair market value, you still must report the dividends as income."
327,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,Dividends Used to Buy More Stock,EY,EXPLANATION,Many large publicly held companies allow stockholders to use their dividends to buy more shares of stock directly from the company. This type of program eliminates the need to use or pay commissions to an agent or broker. You should keep this cost savings in mind when considering a particular dividend reinvestment plan.
328,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,Dividends Used to Buy More Stock,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you are a member of a dividend reinvestment plan that lets you buy more stock at a price less than its fair market value, you must report as dividend income the fair market value of the additional stock on the dividend payment date. You also must report as dividend income any service charge subtracted from your cash dividends before the dividends are used to buy the additional stock. But you may be able to deduct the service charge. See chapter 29 for more information about deducting expenses of producing income. In some dividend reinvestment plans, you can invest more cash to buy shares of stock at a price less than fair market value. If you choose to do this, you must report as dividend income the difference between the cash you invest and the fair market value of the stock you buy. When figuring this amount, use the fair market value of the stock on the dividend payment date."
329,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,Dividends Used to Buy More Stock,EY,EXPLANATION,"Dividend reinvestment plans (often called DRPs)—even those in which employees may make voluntary contributions—should not be confused with retirement plans that invest in company stock. DRPs are open to all stockholders, not just employees. Dividends are immediately reinvested to buy more shares of that company's stock. DRPs are also subject to income taxes annually, whereas income in employee retirement plans is typically tax deferred. DRPs may cause confusion because some plans permit you to reinvest in shares at a discount, usually about 5%. The discount is included in the amount of dividend taxable to you. Example Stock of Company X is selling for $10. You are entitled to $20 in dividends on the stock you hold. Because you are in a DRP that includes a 5% discount, your dividends will buy 2.105 shares of stock. You will report $21.05 of dividend income."
330,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,Dividends Used to Buy More Stock,EY,TAXALERT,"The IRS has privately ruled (PLR 9750033) that shareholders who purchase stock solely through a cash purchase plan will not be treated as having received a distribution of the discount amount. However, if the shareholders participate in both a DRP and the cash purchase aspects of the plan, they will be treated as having received a taxable distribution of the discount amount of the stock."
331,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,Dividends Used to Buy More Stock,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Unless you're very careful, you're likely to get an IRS deficiency notice when you take advantage of a dividend reinvestment plan if you hold the shares that are producing the dividends. Problems can occur if you receive two Forms 1099. One will report the dividends paid on shares you hold. The other Form 1099 will report the discount and the dividends paid on the shares held in the plan. Be sure to reconcile the amounts and report the correct total. Any service charge paid on a dividend reinvestment plan may be taken as an itemized deduction on Schedule A of Form 1040 (subject to the 2% of adjusted gross income limitation explained in chapter 29, Miscellaneous deductions). You should not offset your dividend income with the service charge. If you do, you may receive a notice from the IRS."
332,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,Dividends Used to Buy More Stock,EY,TAXPLANNER,"When you sell shares acquired in a dividend reinvestment plan, you compute the gain or loss in the same way that you normally would by subtracting your cost basis from the proceeds of the sale. Your cost basis includes the amount of dividends that have been reinvested. Usually your only record of the shares’ cost is the annual statement issued by the administrator of the dividend reinvestment plan. It is imperative to keep these statements as a permanent part of your records. If you don't have this information, you can contact the transfer agent who handles the company's dividend reinvestment plan. You can obtain the name from the company's investor relations office. However, some dividend reinvestment plans charge a fee for recreating records. Alternatively, you can look up a company's dividend history in Standard & Poor's. Example You have accumulated 14 shares of ABC Mutual Fund through a purchase and dividend reinvestments."
333,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,Dividends Used to Buy More Stock,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Method Shares Cost Basis Date Purchase 10 shares $100 4/29/12 Dividend Reinvestments 1 share $10 12/31/13  1 share $15 12/31/14  2 shares $25 12/31/15  14 shares $150  If you sold all 14 shares on January 15, 2016, for $15 per share, your gain would be $60 ($210 proceeds less $150 cost basis). Without proof of your dividend reinvestments, however, the IRS could argue that your basis was only the original $100 and your gain was actually $110 ($210 proceeds less$100 cost of original purchase). Note that a portion of your $60 gain would be long-term, but the gain attributable to the 2 shares purchased on December 31, 2015, through the DRP would be short-term, because you would not have owned these shares for more than 12 months. The short-term gain would be $5 of the total gain ($30 proceeds on 2 shares less $25 cost basis). See chapter 16, Reporting gains and losses, to determine how to calculate your gain or loss if you did not sell all 14 shares of ABC Mutual Fund at once."
334,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,Dividends Used to Buy More Stock,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Beginning January 1, 2011, shares acquired through a dividend reinvestment plan may use the average method for computing basis, provided the written plan documents require that at least 10% of every dividend is reinvested in identical stock. Under these basis reporting rules, brokers are required to track adjusted cost basis for mutual fund and DRP (dividend reinvestment plan) shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012. Brokers must track adjusted cost basis in accordance with their default method unless a taxpayer notifies the broker in writing to elect the average basis method. The taxpayer may revoke that election within one year of making the election, or, if the earlier, by the date of the first stock disposition. Once the election is revoked, the basis of the stock reverts to the cost basis for the election. For further discussion, see chapter 13, Basis of property, and chapter 16, Reporting gains and losses."
335,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,Dividends Used to Buy More Stock,EY,TAXSAVER,"Dividend reinvestment plans that permit you to invest at less than market price (e.g., whether by discount or reduction in commissions on purchase) may be a very good deal. In effect, you earn a higher yield because you are receiving “extra” shares. Consider making an average basis method election with your broker for newly acquired shares because in a rising stock market, the average basis method election may result in tax savings, rather than if the broker's default method is utilized."
336,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,Money Market Funds,TaxCode,TAXCODE,Report amounts you receive from money market funds as dividend income. Money market funds are a type of mutual fund and should not be confused with bank money market accounts that pay interest.
337,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Ordinary Dividends,Money Market Funds,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Dividends paid from money market funds are reported as dividends—not interest—even though they represent income the money market fund received on certificates of deposit and other interest-bearing investments. Dividends from money market funds are not eligible for the lower dividend rate. These dividends must be shown in the dividend section of Schedule B (Form 1040). If they are not, you're likely to receive a notice from the IRS requesting an explanation. However, dividends paid or credited by a mutual savings bank, building and loan association, savings and loan association, cooperative bank, or credit union are considered interest—not dividends—for income tax reporting purposes. The Form 1099 that you receive from these organizations tells you which type of income to report and generally instructs you on how to report the income."
338,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Capital Gain Distributions,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Capital gain distributions (also called capital gain dividends) are paid to you or credited to your account by mutual funds (or other regulated investment companies) and real estate investment trusts (REITs). They will be shown in box 2a of the Form 1099-DIV you receive from the mutual fund or REIT. Report capital gain distributions as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you owned your shares in the mutual fund or REIT."
339,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Capital Gain Distributions,,EY,EXPLANATION,"For 2016, capital gain distributions are reported on Schedule D, line 13. For more information, see chapter 16, Reporting gains and losses."
340,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Capital Gain Distributions,,EY,TAXALERT,"Although qualifying dividends are taxed at the same rate as capital gains, a taxpayer who has net capital losses and dividend income may not offset those losses against dividends. Net capital losses can be offset against capital gain distributions, however."
341,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Capital Gain Distributions,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Undistributed capital gains of mutual funds and REITs. Some mutual funds and REITs keep their long-term capital gains and pay tax on them. You must treat your share of these gains as distributions, even though you did not actually receive them. However, they are not included on Form 1099-DIV. Instead, they are reported to you in box 1a of Form 2439, Notice to Shareholder of Undistributed Long-Term Capital Gains. Report undistributed capital gains (box 1a of Form 2439) as long-term capital gains on Schedule D (Form 1040), line 11, column (h).

Basis adjustment. Increase your basis in your mutual fund, or your interest in a REIT, by the difference between the gain you report and the credit you claim for the tax paid. Additional information. For more information on the treatment of distributions from mutual funds, see Publication 550."
342,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Capital Gain Distributions,,EY,EXPLANATION,"An investment company or mutual fund that realizes capital gains during the year has the option of whether or not to distribute the capital gains to shareholders of the mutual fund. The two different treatments are reported by shareholders as follows: Distributed capital gains are reported to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV box 2a. You will receive this amount in cash and must include the entire amount of the distributed capital gains in your calculation of taxable income. Undistributed capital gains are reported to shareholders on Form 2439. You will not receive this amount in cash. Rather, the mutual fund or real estate investment trust (REIT) has retained the capital gains and paid your proportionate share of the tax due. You will include the entire amount of the undistributed capital gains in your calculation of taxable income, but you will also be credited for the tax that the mutual fund paid on your behalf. In addition, you will increase your basis in the stock by the net amount not distributed to you. Example 1 ABC Mutual Fund elects to distribute all of its 2016 capital gain. Each shareholder will receive a pro rata share of the distribution in cash. Each shareholder reports this distribution and pays the appropriate tax. The fund will provide each shareholder with Form 1099-DIV, which contains the amounts to be reported. Example 2 ABC Mutual Fund elects to treat all of its 2016 capital gain as an undistributed capital gain. The shareholders receive no cash distribution. Each shareholder reports his or her share of capital gain and tax paid on his or her behalf by ABC Mutual Fund. These amounts are shown on the Form 2439 that each shareholder receives. If your share of the capital gain is $1,200 and your share of the tax is $408, the $1,200 is included as capital gain income and the $408 is claimed as a credit on your individual return. Increase your basis in the stock by $792, the net amount not distributed to you ($1,200 less $408). Explanation You must report any undistributed gains shown on Form 2439 in addition to any capital gain distributions reported on Form 1099-DIV."
343,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Nondividend Distributions,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"A nondividend distribution is a distribution that is not paid out of the earnings and profits of a corporation or a mutual fund. You should receive a Form 1099-DIV or other statement showing the nondividend distribution. On Form 1099-DIV, a nondividend distribution will be shown in box 3. If you do not receive such a statement, you report the distribution as an ordinary dividend. Basis adjustment. A nondividend distribution reduces the basis of your stock. It is not taxed until your basis in the stock is fully recovered. This nontaxable portion is also called a return of capital; it is a return of your investment in the stock of the company. If you buy stock in a corporation in different lots at different times, and you cannot definitely identify the shares subject to the nondividend distribution, reduce the basis of your earliest purchases first. When the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero, report any additional nondividend distribution you receive as a capital gain. Whether you report it as a long-term or short-term capital gain depends on how long you have held the stock. See Holding Period in chapter 14. Example. You bought stock in 2002 for $100. In 2004, you received a nondividend distribution of $80. You did not include this amount in your income, but you reduced the basis of your stock to $20. You received a nondividend distribution of $30 in 2016. The first $20 of this amount reduced your basis to zero. You report the other $10 as a long-term capital gain for 2016. You must report as a long-term capital gain any nondividend distribution you receive on this stock in later years."
344,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Nondividend Distributions,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Some mutual fund dividends may be treated as a tax-free return of capital. This occurs when the mutual fund does not have enough current or accumulated earnings and profits to cover the distribution. In this situation, the distribution is considered to be a “return of capital” (the amount you originally invested) and is nontaxable to the extent of the basis in your shares. (Your basis is generally the price at which you bought the shares plus or minus any adjustments. See chapter 13, Basis of property.) This amount will be shown in box 3 of Form 1099-DIV. Although the distribution is tax-free, it will reduce your basis in the mutual fund shares. To the extent the distribution is greater than your basis in your shares, you will be treated as having a gain from the sale or exchange of the shares. This gain must be reported on Schedule D (Form 1040). (See the IRS example directly preceding this explanation.)"
345,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Nondividend Distributions,,EY,TAXORGANIZER,It is extremely important to keep accurate records of nontaxable dividends. Most people do not realize that a nontaxable dividend is usually considered a return of purchase price and then a capital gain once your cost has been recovered. Keep in mind that even nontaxable dividends can become subject to tax at some point.
346,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Nondividend Distributions,Liquidating Distributions,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Liquidating distributions, sometimes called liquidating dividends, are distributions you receive during a partial or complete liquidation of a corporation. These distributions are, at least in part, one form of a return of capital. They may be paid in one or more installments. You will receive Form 1099-DIV from the corporation showing you the amount of the liquidating distribution in box  8 or 9. For more information on liquidating distributions, see chapter 1 of Publication 550."
347,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Nondividend Distributions,Liquidating Distributions,EY,TAXSAVER,"If the total liquidating distributions you receive are less than the basis of your stock, you may have a capital loss. You can report a capital loss only after you have received the final distribution in liquidation that results in the redemption or cancellation of the stock. Whether you report the loss as a long-term or short-term capital loss depends on how long you held the stock. See Holding Period in chapter 14, Sale of property. Example You own stock in XYZ Corporation with a basis of $100. You received liquidating distributions of $90: $60 in 2015 and $30 in 2016. You report the $10 loss in 2016."
348,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Nondividend Distributions,Distributions of Stock and Stock Rights,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Distributions by a corporation of its own stock are commonly known as stock dividends. Stock rights (also known as “stock options”) are distributions by a corporation of rights to acquire the corporation's stock. Generally, stock dividends and stock rights are not taxable to you, and you do not report them on your return. Taxable stock dividends and stock rights. Distributions of stock dividends and stock rights are taxable to you if any of the following apply. 1.    You or any other shareholder have the choice to receive cash or other property instead of stock or stock rights. 2.    The distribution gives cash or other property to some shareholders and an increase in the percentage interest in the corporation's assets or earnings and profits to other shareholders. 3.    The distribution is in convertible preferred stock and has the same result as in (2). 4.    The distribution gives preferred stock to some common stock shareholders and common stock to other common stock shareholders. 5.    The distribution is on preferred stock. (The distribution, however, is not taxable if it is an increase in the conversion ratio of convertible preferred stock made solely to take into account a stock dividend, stock split, or similar event that would otherwise result in reducing the conversion right.)"
349,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Nondividend Distributions,Distributions of Stock and Stock Rights,EY,EXPLANATION,"Any transaction having the effect of increasing your proportionate interest in a corporation's assets or earnings and profits may be taxable to you, even though no stock or stock rights are actually distributed. A number of transactions, for example, a change in the conversion ratio on certain classes of stock or a change in the redemption price of certain securities, have the effect of increasing your proportionate interest in a corporation. If such a transaction occurs, you will be informed by the corporation."
350,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Nondividend Distributions,Distributions of Stock and Stock Rights,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"The term “stock” includes rights to acquire stock, and the term “shareholder” includes a holder of rights or of convertible securities. If you receive taxable stock dividends or stock rights, include their fair market value at the time of distribution in your income."
351,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Nondividend Distributions,Distributions of Stock and Stock Rights,EY,EXAMPLE,"ABC Company gives its shareholders the option of receiving a dividend as $10 cash or as stock (thus, the distribution will be taxable to all shareholders). On February 15, the date of distribution, the value of 1 share of stock is $5. A shareholder who chooses stock in lieu of cash will receive 2 additional shares of stock on February 15. This shareholder will be taxed on $10, the fair market value of the stock, even though no cash was received with which to pay the tax. A shareholder who chooses cash will also be taxed on $10, but this shareholder will have the cash in hand to pay the tax."
352,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Nondividend Distributions,Distributions of Stock and Stock Rights,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Preferred stock redeemable at a premium. If you receive preferred stock having a redemption price higher than its issue price, the difference (the redemption premium) generally is taxable as a constructive distribution of additional stock on the preferred stock. For more information, see chapter 1 of Publication 550. Basis. Your basis in stock or stock rights received in a taxable distribution is their fair market value when distributed. If you receive stock or stock rights that are not taxable to you, see Stocks and Bonds under Basis of Investment Property in chapter 4 of Publication 550 for information on how to figure their basis. Fractional shares. You may not own enough stock in a corporation to receive a full share of stock if the corporation declares a stock dividend. However, with the approval of the shareholders, the corporation may set up a plan in which fractional shares are not issued but instead are sold, and the cash proceeds are given to the shareholders. Any cash you receive for fractional shares under such a plan is treated as an amount realized on the sale of the fractional shares. Report this transaction on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets. Enter your gain or loss, the difference between the cash you receive and the basis of the fractional shares sold, in column (h) of Schedule D (Form 1040) in Part I or Part II, whichever is appropriate."

Also see the Instructions for Form 8949 and the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). Example. You own one share of common stock that you bought on January 3, 2005, for $100. The corporation declared a common stock dividend of 5% on June 30, 2016. The fair market value of the stock at the time the stock dividend was declared was $200. You were paid $10 for the fractional-share stock dividend under a plan described in the discussion above. You figure your gain or loss as follows: Fair market value of old stock $200.00 Fair market value of stock dividend (cash received) +10.00 Fair market value of old stock and stock dividend $210.00 Basis (cost) of old stock after the stock dividend (($200   ÷ $210) × $100) $95.24 Basis (cost) of stock dividend (($10 ÷ $210) × $100) + 4.76 Total $100.00 Cash received $10.00 Basis (cost) of stock dividend −4.76 Gain $5.24 Because you had held the share of stock for more than 1 year at the time the stock dividend was declared, your gain on the stock dividend is a long-term capital gain."
355,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Nondividend Distributions,Distributions of Stock and Stock Rights,EY,EXPLANATION,"It is not true that all amounts received with regard to fractional shares are treated as capital gains, as described in the IRS text. A distinction is made when shareholders have the option of receiving cash or other property instead of fractional shares. If shareholders have this option and receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, the value received is treated as dividend income. If the corporation issues cash in lieu of fractional shares of stock for the purpose of saving the trouble, expense, and inconvenience of issuing fractional shares, then the capital gain treatment described earlier applies. The transaction will be treated as though fractional shares had been received by the shareholders and were then redeemed by the corporation."
356,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Nondividend Distributions,Distributions of Stock and Stock Rights,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Scrip dividends. A corporation that declares a stock dividend may issue you a scrip certificate that entitles you to a fractional share. The certificate is generally nontaxable when you receive it. If you choose to have the corporation sell the certificate for you and give you the proceeds, your gain or loss is the difference between the proceeds and the portion of your basis in the corporation's stock allocated to the certificate. However, if you receive a scrip certificate that you can choose to redeem for cash instead of stock, the certificate is taxable when you receive it.

Exempt-interest dividends you receive from a mutual fund or other regulated investment company, including those received from a qualified fund of funds in any tax year beginning after December 22, 2010, are not included in your taxable income. Exempt-interest dividends should be shown in box  10 of Form 1099-DIV."
358,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Other Distributions,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Exempt-interest dividends are reported on line 8b of Form 1040 as tax-exempt interest. While exempt-interest dividends are exempt from federal income taxes, they may be considered an “add-back” for state and local tax purposes. This treatment depends on which state returns you are required to file. Generally, your state may require that you add back to federal adjusted gross income either all or some portion of the amount you entered on line 8b of your 1040. See your state income tax forms and instructions for guidance."

Exempt-interest dividends paid from specified private activity bonds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax. See Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) in chapter 31 for more information. Dividends on insurance policies. Insurance policy dividends the insurer keeps and uses to pay your premiums are not taxable. However, you must report as taxable interest income the interest that is paid or credited on dividends left with the insurance company. If dividends on an insurance contract (other than a modified endowment contract) are distributed to you, they are a partial return of the premiums you paid. Do not include them in your gross income until they are more than the total of all net premiums you paid for the contract. Report any taxable distributions on insurance policies on Form 1040, line 21. Dividends on veterans’ insurance. Dividends you receive on veterans’ insurance policies are not taxable. In addition, interest on dividends left with the Department of Veterans Affairs is not taxable. Patronage dividends. Generally, patronage dividends you receive in money from a cooperative organization are included in your income. Do not include in your income patronage dividends you receive on: §  Property bought for your personal use, or §  Capital assets or depreciable property bought for use in your business. But you must reduce the basis (cost) of the items bought. If the dividend is more than the adjusted basis of the assets, you must report the excess as income. These rules are the same whether the cooperative paying the dividend is a taxable or tax-exempt cooperative."
360,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,Other Distributions,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Patronage dividends are amounts paid by a cooperative organization to one of its patrons (1) on the basis of the quantity or quality of business done with the patron, (2) pursuant to a written obligation in existence before the cooperative received the amounts paid into it by the patron, and (3) determined by reference to net earnings. In other words, patronage dividends amount to a return of some of the amounts a patron spent with a cooperative. Patronage dividends usually occur with farm cooperatives. Any “refund” or “discount” to the patron is income. However, if the purchase leading to receipt of the dividend was neither deductible nor considered a capital expense, the dividend really amounts to a discount or a rebate, which is not considered income."

However, if you get dividends on the restricted stock, you must include them in your income as wages, not dividends. At the time that the restrictions are lifted and you have full access to the stock, dividends are treated as taxable dividend income. If you get both a 1099-DIV and a W-2, which includes the dividends on your restricted stock, it is important to report the taxable dividend amount only once on your tax return. To avoid notices generated from the IRS's document-matching program, statements must be included with your return to explain any discrepancies between the amounts reported by you and the amounts indicated on Form 1099-DIV or Form W-2."

A more complete discussion of these items appears in chapter 29, Miscellaneous deductions. Explanation Stock sold short. If you borrow stock to make a short sale, you may have to pay the lender an amount to replace the dividends distributed while you maintain your short position. Your treatment of the payment depends on the kind of distribution for which you are reimbursing the lender of the stock."
374,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,How To Report Dividend Income,,EY,TAXALERT,"Owners whose shares are lent in short sales do not receive the lower capital gains rate on “payments in lieu of dividends,” which are often called “substitute” dividends. Brokerages commonly lend stock held in margin accounts to short sellers, but may need to accommodate investors who do not want to receive the unfavorable dividend treatment. If this pertains to your investments, your Form 1099-DIV should indicate the status of your dividends. See chapter 14, Sale of property, for an explanation of a short sale."
375,Chapter 8,Dividends and other corporate distributions,How To Report Dividend Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"If you borrow stock to make a short sale, and you pay the lender in lieu of the dividends distributed while you maintain your short position, you can deduct these payments provided you hold the short sale open at least 46 days (more than 1 year in the case of an extraordinary dividend as defined later) and you itemize your deductions. You deduct these expenses as investment interest on Schedule A (Form 1040). If you close the short sale on or before the 45th day after the date of the short sale (1 year or less in the case of an extraordinary dividend), you cannot deduct the payments made. Instead you must increase the basis of the stock used to close the short sale by that amount. Exception The IRS allows a deduction for amounts you pay in place of dividends to the extent of ordinary income received from the lender of the stock for the use of collateral with the short sale. However, this special rule does not apply to payments in place of extraordinary dividends, discussed next. Explanation Extraordinary dividends. If the amount of any dividend you receive on a share of preferred stock equals or exceeds 5% (10% in the case of other stock) of the amount realized on the short sale, the dividend you receive is an extraordinary dividend. If your payment is made for a liquidating distribution or nontaxable stock distribution, or if you buy more shares equal to a stock distribution issued on the borrowed stock during your short position, you have a capital expense. You must add the payment to the cost of the stock sold short. See Short Sales in Publication 550 for more information about the tax treatment of short sales. If an individual receives an extraordinary dividend eligible for the capital gain rates with respect to any share of stock, any loss on the sale of the stock is treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of the dividend. A dividend is treated as investment income for purposes of determining the amount of deductible investment interest only if the taxpayer elects to treat the dividend as not eligible for the capital gain rates. Example Ben feels that the market value of XYZ Corporation stock is going to decline, so he sells XYZ stock to Sally. However, Ben does not hold any XYZ stock so, to effect the transaction, Ben's broker borrows XYZ stock from another customer, Robert, to deliver to Sally. Sally is now the stockholder of record. XYZ Corporation will pay any and all dividends on this stock directly to Sally. However, Robert is entitled to the money, because he merely lent his shares to Ben. Ben, not XYZ Corporation, will pay Robert the amount of the dividend. Ben may deduct the payment as an itemized deduction on Schedule A if he borrows the stock for more than 45 days and has not diminished his risk of loss by, for example, holding an option to buy substantially similar stock. Robert enters that amount on page 1 (Form 1040) as income from Ben. If Ben returns the stock within 45 days, he will not be able to claim a deduction. The amount paid to Robert increases the basis of the stock sold."

380,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,,,EY,Introduction,"Rent is the income received for allowing another person to use property that you own. This income is customarily received in cash. If, in lieu of paying all or part of the rent in cash, a tenant provides you with certain services, the value of those services is rental income to you. You may deduct expenses incurred to repair or to maintain your rental property. However, certain other expenses may not be deducted in the year in which you pay for them; rather, they must be capitalized and deducted over a period of years. You may also deduct any depreciation taken on your rental property. Depreciation is a noncash expense claimed in order to deduct each year a small part of what you originally paid for the property. There are a variety of methods by which you may depreciate property and calculate your tax deduction. These methods are explained in this chapter. Rental real estate activities are generally considered passive activities, and the amount of any loss you can deduct is limited unless you have income from other passive activities or you “materially” or “actively” participate in your rental activity. This chapter explains the rules for figuring rental income, expenses, depreciation, and allowable losses. In addition to paying regular income tax or alternative minimum tax on rental income, a 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) is assessed on unearned Net Investment Income (NII). For individuals, the NIIT is 3.8% of the lesser of: (1) NII or (2) the excess of modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $200,000 ($250,000 if married filing jointly; $125,000 if married filing separately). Net investment income includes income from passive activities. For most taxpayers, rental activities are treated as passive, and any net rental income is subject to the NIIT. On the other hand, rental income derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business by certain real estate professionals is considered to be nonpassive, and therefore is not subject to the NIIT. For more information, see Passive Activity Limits, later in this chapter. A detailed overview of the NIIT can be found in 49, Net Investment Income Tax."
381,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Introduction,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,This chapter discusses rental income and expenses. It also covers the following topics. §  Personal use of dwelling unit (including vacation home). §  Depreciation. §  Limits on rental losses. §  How to report your rental income and expenses.
382,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Introduction,,EY,Tax Breaks and Deductions You Can Use Checklist,"Rental expenses. You can deduct the cost of rental expenses from your rental income. Expenses include advertising, cleaning and maintenance services, utilities, property insurance, taxes, interest on a loan taken out to buy or improve the rental property, commissions paid to collect rent, management fees, legal and other professional fees, ordinary and necessary travel and transportation, repairs, depreciation on amounts paid to acquire the property and to make subsequent improvements, and amortization of points paid to acquire a mortgage on the rental property. For more details, see Rental Expenses and Other Expenses, later. Rental expenses of vacant rental property. You can deduct the expenses of managing and maintaining a rental property during the time it is being marketed for rent for the first time and in between rentals, as long as it is actively being held out for rent. For more details, see Rental Expenses, later. Deducting repairs and capitalizing improvements. You can deduct the full amount of the cost of repairs made to your rental property in the year paid (for a cash-basis taxpayer). On the other hand, the cost of improvements cannot be deducted currently but rather must be capitalized and then recovered over time by taking depreciation. An expense can be considered a repair if it keeps the property in good working condition but does not increase its value nor its useful life. An improvement adds to the value of property, prolongs its useful life, or adapts the property to new uses. For more details, see Repairs and Improvements, later. Exclusion of rental income from a home rented for less than 15 days during the year. If a dwelling unit is used as a personal home and you rent it for less than 15 days during the year, you can exclude all of the rental income received from your taxable income. You are also not permitted to deduct any rental expenses paid. Note, however, that you can continue to deduct qualified residence interest, real estate taxes, and casualty and theft losses if you itemize deductions. For details, see Exception for Minimal Rental Use, later. Passive rental losses allowed as a deduction. There is an exception to the general rule that disallows a deduction for passive rental losses. If you actively participate in a passive rental real estate activity (you actively participate if you and your spouse owned at least 10% of the rental property and you made significant management decisions—such as approving new tenants, deciding on rental terms, and approving expenditures for the property), you can deduct up to $25,000 of your losses from the activity from your nonpassive income. However, if your modified adjusted gross income is $150,000 or more ($75,000 or more if you are married filing separately), this exception to the passive loss deduction rules is not available. For more details, see Losses From Rental Real Estate Activities, later."
383,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Introduction,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you sell or otherwise dispose of your rental property, see Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets. If you have a loss from damage to, or theft of, rental property, see Publication 547, Casualties, Disasters, and Thefts. If you rent a condominium or a cooperative apartment, some special rules apply to you even though you receive the same tax treatment as other owners of rental property.

385,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"In most cases, you must include in your gross income all amounts you receive as rent. Rental income is any payment you receive for the use or occupation of property. In addition to amounts you receive as normal rent payments, there are other amounts that may be rental income. When to report. If you are a cash-basis taxpayer, you report rental income on your return for the year you actually or constructively receive it. You are a cash-basis taxpayer if you report income in the year you receive it, regardless of when it was earned. You constructively receive income when it is made available to you, for example, by being credited to your bank account. If you are an accrual basis taxpayer, you generally report income when you earn it, rather than when you receive it. You generally deduct your expenses when you incur them, rather than when you pay them. See Publication 538, Accounting Periods and Methods, for more information. For more information about when you constructively receive income, see Accounting Methods in chapter 1. Advance rent. Advance rent is any amount you receive before the period that it covers. Include advance rent in your rental income in the year you receive it regardless of the period covered or the method of accounting you use. Example. You sign a 10-year lease to rent your property. In the first year, you receive $5,000 for the first year's rent and $5,000 as rent for the last year of the lease. You must include $10,000 in your income in the first year."
386,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Some taxpayers have attempted to circumvent the rule requiring advance rent to be included in current income by structuring the payment as a “loan.” The courts have generally disallowed this technique and examine this type of transaction with close scrutiny. As a general rule, if such a loan is to be repaid out of future rental proceeds, the loan will probably be considered advance rent. However, the courts have held that an up-front payment for an option to purchase the property is not considered advance rent and, as such, does not have to be included in income where the agreement provides no provision for returning the money to the renter or applying it to the rent. Even if a promissory note is written to support the “loan,” the courts will look to the parties’ intent, as well as to other factors such as interest charged, whether the loan is secured, and whether the loan payment and rental dates are identified."
387,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Generally, the distinction between advance rent and security deposits depends on the nature of the rights and obligations that are assumed when the deposit is made. If, for example, the landlord has the option either to refund a security deposit or to apply it to a future year's rent, the courts have held that the landlord has unrestricted use of the money and that it is considered advance rent. In cases in which the landlord is required by law to pay interest on the security deposit, the deposit generally is not considered advance rent."
388,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Landlords may forget whether they have treated a security deposit as a true security deposit or as advance rent. If this happens, the landlord may not be sure how to treat the refund and/or application of the security deposit at the end of the term of the lease. Be sure to note in your records exactly how you are treating the amount for tax purposes so that the tax returns for the year in which the security deposit is returned and/or applied will be easy to prepare."
389,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,EY,TAXSAVER,"Advice for landlords. When drawing up a rental agreement, it is helpful to include language specifying that the security deposit is not to be used for the last month's rent. This helps ensure deferred recognition of the security deposit as income until such time as you determine it should not be refunded."
390,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Canceling a lease. If your tenant pays you to cancel a lease, the amount you receive is rent. Include the payment in your income in the year you receive it regardless of your method of accounting."
391,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"The courts have ruled that any payments you receive as consideration for modifying the terms of an existing lease must be treated as ordinary income. However, certain expenses incurred as a result of the cancellation or modification of a lease may be deductible currently. For example, attorney fees attributable to the lessee's forfeiture and termination of a lease would be deductible currently. On the other hand, if the lessor caused the termination, the expense usually would be amortized over a period of time. You should consult your tax advisor."
392,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,EY,TAXSAVER,"A payment for cancellation of a lease may be very large, depending on the time left on the lease and the agreement of the parties. As with most types of income to cash basis taxpayers, arranging for the receipt of this payment in a year in which you have a lower marginal tax rate may save you taxes."
393,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Expenses paid by tenant. If your tenant pays any of your expenses, the payments are rental income. Because you must include this amount in income, you can deduct the expenses if they are deductible rental expenses. See Rental Expenses, later, for more information. Example 1. Your tenant pays the water and sewage bill for your rental property and deducts the amount from the normal rent payment. Under the terms of the lease, your tenant does not have to pay this bill. Include the utility bill paid by the tenant and any amount received as a rent payment in your rental income. You can deduct the utility payment made by your tenant as a rental expense. Example 2. While you are out of town, the furnace in your rental property stops working. Your tenant pays for the necessary repairs and deducts the repair bill from the rent payment. Include the repair bill paid by the tenant and any amount received as a rent payment in your rental income. You can deduct the repair payment made by your tenant as a rental expense."
394,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"When a tenant pays to have capital improvements constructed on the landlord's property and these improvements are not made in lieu of rent or other required payments, the value of these improvements is not income to the landlord, either when made or on termination of the lease, even though the landlord keeps the improvements at the end of the lease. However, the landlord will have no basis in the improvements and, therefore, cannot depreciate the improvements. Example 1 Susan rents an apartment to Pam. Pam, at her own expense, constructs a wall to separate the dining area from the living room. At the end of the lease, Pam vacates the apartment, leaving the wall. Susan does not record income at any time, even though she may benefit from the capital improvement. Susan may not depreciate the value of the wall because she has no basis in the wall. If Susan must incur an expense to remove the wall and restore the property, it is either deducted from income or capitalized, depending on factors discussed later in this chapter. Example 2 Ken rents an apartment to Anthony for $550. Anthony pays for plumbing repairs of $150, which he in turn deducts out of his current month's rent. Although Ken has received only $400 from Anthony, he must report the entire rent amount of $550 as income. Ken may also be able to report the $150 for plumbing repairs as a deductible expense. Other examples of landlord expenses paid by a tenant that would be considered rental income include a tenant's payment of a landlord's real estate taxes, mortgage payments, or income taxes."
395,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"It would be unusual for an expense that is the responsibility of the landlord not to be deductible by the landlord when the tenant pays the expense. But such expenses do exist. Consider, for example, a building code violation fine incurred for some change made in the tenant's space by the tenant without the landlord's consent. The fine is imposed on the landlord, but the violation is the tenant's fault. The tenant pays the penalty, but the landlord still has to declare that amount as income. Since most penalties are not deductible, the landlord probably will not be able to deduct the amount of the fine as an expense. If this is a possibility, a clause in the lease making the payment of such a penalty the responsibility of the tenant when the tenant is at fault would probably keep the payment by the tenant from being income to the landlord."
396,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Property or services. If you receive property or services, instead of money, as rent, include the fair market value of the property or services in your rental income."
397,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,EY,EXAMPLE,"Denise rents a home to a licensed contractor for $700 per month. The home needed repairs to the kitchen flooring, and the contractor agreed to make the repairs in exchange for living in the home rent-free for 2 months. Denise must report the fair market value of the repairs as rental income (presumably the fair market value would be equal to 2 months’ rent, or $1,400). Denise may be able to claim a deduction for the repair of the kitchen floor."
398,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Examples of other types of income treated as rental income include the following: 1. Amounts received from an insurance company under a policy that reimburses a property owner for rent lost because of a fire or other casualty affecting the rental property. 2. Amounts received by subletting a property to another individual. If you did receive such income, you would be able to deduct the rent you are paying to the landlord as an expense. However, you are still not the owner and therefore would not be able to depreciate the property."
399,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If the services are provided at an agreed upon or specified price, that price is the fair market value unless there is evidence to the contrary. Security deposits. Do not include a security deposit in your income when you receive it if you plan to return it to your tenant at the end of the lease. But if you keep part or all of the security deposit during any year because your tenant does not live up to the terms of the lease, include the amount you keep in your income in that year. If an amount called a security deposit is to be used as a final payment of rent, it is advance rent. Include it in your income when you receive it. If you keep part of all of the security deposit because the tenant breaks the lease by vacating the property early, include the amount you keep in your income that year. If you keep part or all of the security deposit because the tenant damaged the property and you must make repairs, include the amount you keep in that year if your practice is to deduct the cost of repairs as expenses. To the extent the security deposit reimburses those expenses, do not include the amount in income if your practice is not to deduct the cost of repairs as expenses. If a security deposit amount is to be used as the tenant's final month's rent, it is advance rent that you include as income when you receive it, rather than when you apply it to the last month's rent. Part interest. If you own a part interest in rental property, you must report your part of the rental income from the property. Rental of property also used as your home. If you rent property that you also use as your home and you rent it less than 15 days during the tax year, do not include the rent you receive in your income and do not deduct rental expenses. However, you can deduct on Schedule A (Form 1040) the interest, taxes, and casualty and theft losses that are allowed for nonrental property. See Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home), later."
400,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,EY,TAXALERT,"If you plan to convert your rental property into your principal residence, the amount of gain you may be able to exclude from a future sale of that home may be limited. Generally, you are allowed to exclude up to $250,000 ($500,000 if married filing a joint return) of gain realized on the sale or exchange of a principal residence. The sale of a home will qualify for this exclusion if the home is a taxpayer's principal residence for at least two of the five years ending on the date of the sale or exchange. Under this law, the period of time you rented the residence after 2008 and before you converted it into your principal residence will figure into a formula that reduces the maximum exclusion ($250,000 or $500,000 if married filing a joint return) you can apply to offset gains realized when you ultimately sell that home. See chapter 15, Selling your home, for more information."
401,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Income,,EY,TaxAlert,"The New “Sharing Economy.” An emerging area of activity in the past few years, the sharing economy has changed how people commute, travel, rent vacation places, and perform many other activities. Also referred to as the on-demand, gig, or access economy, sharing economies allow individuals and groups to utilize technology advancements to arrange transactions to generate revenue from assets they possess—(such as cars and homes)—or services they provide—(such as household chores or technology services). Although this is a developing area of the economy, there are tax implications for the companies that provide the services and the individuals who perform the services. In August 2016, the IRS posted relevant information for those participating the sharing economy.

403,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Expenses,,EY,TAXSAVER,"You may deduct expenses on your rental property during a period in which it is not being rented as long as it is actively being held out for rent. This applies to a period between rentals, as well as to the period during which a property is being marketed as a rental property for the first time. The IRS can disallow these deductions if you are unable to show you were actively seeking a profit and had a reasonable expectation of achieving one. The deduction cannot be disallowed just because your property is difficult to rent."
404,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Expenses,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Personal use of rental property. If you sometimes use your rental property for personal purposes, you must divide your expenses between rental and personal use. Also, your rental expense deductions may be limited. See Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home), later. Part interest. If you own a part interest in rental property, you can deduct expenses that you paid according to your percentage of ownership. Example. Roger owns a one-half undivided interest in a rental house. Last year he paid $968 for necessary repairs on the property. Roger can deduct $484 (50% x $968) as a rental expense. He is entitled to reimbursement for the remaining half from the co-owner. When to deduct. If you are a cash-basis taxpayer, you generally deduct your rental expenses in the year you pay them. If you use the accrual method, see Publication 538 for more information. Depreciation. Depreciation is a capital expense. It is the mechanism for recovering your cost in an income producing property and must be taken over the expected life of the property. You can begin to depreciate rental property when it is ready and available for rent. See Placed-in-Service under When Does Depreciation Begin and End in chapter 2 of Publication 527. Prerental expenses. You can deduct your ordinary and necessary expenses for managing, conserving, or maintaining rental property from the time you make it available for rent. Uncollected rent. If you are a cash-basis taxpayer, do not deduct uncollected rent. Because you have not included it in your income, it is not deductible. Vacant rental property. If you hold property for rental purposes, you may be able to deduct your ordinary and necessary expenses (including depreciation) for managing, conserving, or maintaining the property while the property is vacant. However, you cannot deduct any loss of rental income for the period the property is vacant."
405,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Expenses,,EY,EXAMPLE,"You own a rental property that was vacant for about half the year. You had rental income of $12,000 during the year and ordinary and necessary expenses of $15,000, which resulted in an overall loss of $3,000. As long as you can demonstrate that you have been actively trying to rent the house (e.g., newspaper or online clippings advertising the property for rent), you would be able to deduct your expenses up to $12,000. If you meet the passive activity loss rules discussed later in this chapter, the remaining $3,000 of expenses can be carried over to the next year or deducted in the current year if qualified. See Losses from Real Estate Activities, later in this chapter, for special rules and how to report rental income and expenses. Also see How to Report Rental Income and Expenses, later in this chapter."
406,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Rental Expenses,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Vacant while listed for sale. If you sell property you held for rental purposes, you can deduct the ordinary and necessary expenses for managing, conserving, or maintaining the property until it is sold. If the property is not held out and available for rent while listed for sale, the expenses are not deductible rental expenses."
407,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Generally, an expense for repairing or maintaining your rental property may be deducted if you are not required to capitalize the expense. Improvements. You must capitalize any expense you pay to improve your rental property. An expense is for an improvement if it results in a betterment to your property, restores your property, or adapts your property to a new or different use. Betterments. Expenses that may result in a betterment to your property include expenses for fixing a pre-existing defect or condition, enlarging or expanding your property, or increasing the capacity, strength, or quality of your property. Restoration. Expenses that may be for restoration include expenses for replacing a substantial structural part of your property, repairing damage to your property after you properly adjusted the basis of your property as a result of a casualty loss, or rebuilding your property to a like-new condition. Adaptation. Expenses that may be for adaptation include expenses for altering your property to a use that is not consistent with the intended ordinary use of your property when you began renting the property. The expenses you capitalize for improving your property can generally be depreciated as if the improvement were separate property."
408,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,,EY,Records,"Separate the costs of repairs and improvements, and keep accurate records. You will need to know the cost of improvements when you sell or depreciate your property."
409,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,,EY,EXPLANATION,"If a so-called improvement does not prolong useful life or add to value, it is deductible currently as a repair. It is the “nature” of the repair rather than the “amount” that determines whether it is deductible or not. Examples Examples of capitalized expenses are as follows: ·    Improvements made to property to comply with government regulations ·    Expenditures to place property in a safe condition ·    Face-lifting to improve property's appearance ·    Replacement of flashing around a building's roof ·    Replacement of a gravel driveway with a cement driveway ·    Replacing a floor ·    Replacing or recovering a roof Examples of deductible expenses are as follows: ·    Replacing a portion of a wooden bathroom when damage has been caused by water ·    Repainting or repapering a room in a rooming house when it is necessary to keep the area clean and serviceable ·    Reinforcing sagging floors ·    Resurfacing a parking lot ·    Making piecemeal repairs to floors"
410,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,,EY,TAXORGANIZER,"All records and receipts of your rental expenditures, and what they were specifically for, should be kept for a minimum of three years. This will allow you to substantiate items relating to your rental property if the IRS should have any questions. For improvements that are capitalized, receipts need to be maintained for a minimum of three years after the tax return filing for the year the rental property is sold. It is extremely important to keep accurate records of expenditures segregated for repairs that are currently deductible and improvements that are capitalized. Generally, IRS agents give close attention to repair and maintenance deductions. Sometimes expenditures have completely been disallowed unless the taxpayer can prove each specific amount of repair."
411,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,Other Expenses,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Other expenses you can deduct from your rental income include advertising, cleaning and maintenance, utilities, fire and liability insurance, taxes, interest, commissions for the collection of rent, ordinary and necessary travel and transportation, and other expenses, discussed next."
412,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,Other Expenses,EY,EXPLANATION,"Although commissions paid to collect rent are deductible, commissions paid to obtain long-term rentals (greater than a 1-year period) must be capitalized and amortized. Commissions paid to acquire the rental property must be capitalized as part of the basis of that property and recovered when the property is depreciated. Points paid to acquire a mortgage on the rental property must be amortized over the life of the mortgage. These charges are also called loan origination fees, maximum loan charges, or premium charges. Any of these charges (points) that are solely for the use of money are interest. Because points are prepaid interest, you generally cannot deduct the full amount in the year paid, but must deduct the interest over the term of the loan. Other deductible expenses connected to renting include legal costs for dispossessing a tenant, property management fees, and pest control fees. The “ordinary and necessary travel and transportation” category includes local transportation. You may be able to deduct your ordinary and necessary local transportation expenses if you incur them to collect rental income or to manage, conserve, or maintain your rental property. It also covers the cost of meals and lodging on trips to inspect rental property located outside the immediate area. However, for the cost of nonlocal transportation and some other expenses to be deductible, the primary purpose of the trip must be to take care of the rental property. (See chapter 27, Car expenses and other employee business expenses, for a discussion of how to deduct expenses when you use your personal automobile in your trade or business.) In addition, the expense must be “ordinary” in nature. An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted for the activity. Example If you take a 1-week trip to Florida and spend 1 day inspecting your rental property, no nonlocal transportation expenses are deductible. If, on the other hand, 6 of the 7 days are used to repair and attend to the property, all nonlocal transportation expenses are deductible. In both cases, local transportation expenses incurred traveling to and from the property are deductible. However, if a stretch limousine is rented for the local travel, more than likely the IRS would not consider the expense an “ordinary” expense. Any deduction allowed would be limited to the amount that would be considered “ordinary,” such as the cost of a rental car or cab fare."
413,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,Other Expenses,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Insurance premiums paid in advance. If you pay an insurance premium for more than one year in advance, for each year of coverage you can deduct the part of the premium payment that will apply to that year. You cannot deduct the total premium in the year you pay it. See chapter 6 in Publication 535 for information on deductible premiums. Legal and other professional fees. You can deduct, as a rental expense, legal and other professional expenses, such as tax return preparation fees you paid to prepare Schedule E (Form 1040), Part I. For example, on your 2016 Schedule E, you can deduct fees paid in 2016 to prepare your 2015 Schedule E, Part I. You can also deduct, as a rental expense, any expense (other than federal taxes and penalties) you paid to resolve a tax underpayment related to your rental activities. Local benefit. In most cases, you cannot deduct charges for local benefits that increase the value of your property, such as charges for putting in streets, sidewalks, or water and sewer systems. These charges are nondepreciable capital expenditures, and must be added to the basis of your property. However, you can deduct local benefit taxes that are for maintaining, repairing, or paying interest charges for the benefits."
414,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,Other Expenses,EY,TAXSAVER,"Whether or not you are offering property for rent, it is important to keep a file on the assessments you pay for sewers, streets, and the like. These add to your cost basis in the property and are important in determining your gain or loss if you ever sell the property. In addition, if you do rent the property out, the increase in your cost basis for any special assessment may increase your depreciation deduction, depending on the type of assessment."
415,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,Other Expenses,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Local transportation expenses. You may be able to deduct your ordinary and necessary local transportation expenses if you incur them to collect rental income or to manage, conserve, or maintain your rental property. However, transportation expenses incurred to travel between your home and a rental property generally constitute nondeductible commuting costs unless you use your home as your principal place of business. See Publication 587, Business Use of Your Home, for information on determining if your home office qualifies as a principal place of business. Generally, if you use your personal car, pickup truck, or light van for rental activities, you can deduct the expenses using one of two methods: actual expenses or the standard mileage rate. For 2016, the standard mileage rate for business use is 54 cents per mile. For more information, see chapter 27. Rental of equipment. You can deduct the rent you pay for equipment that you use for rental purposes. However, in some cases, lease contracts are actually purchase contracts. If so, you cannot deduct these payments. You can recover the cost of purchased equipment through depreciation."
416,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,Other Expenses,EY,Records,"To deduct car expenses under either method, you must keep records that follow the rules in chapter 27. In addition, you must complete Form 4562, Part V, and attach it to your tax return."
417,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,Other Expenses,EY,EXPLANATION,"A lease with an option to buy may be a purchase contract. Generally, if the sum of the rental payments on a lease with an option to buy amounts to a substantial part of what would be the purchase price, and if the option period is clearly less than the useful life of the property, the transaction is treated as a sale. Income is recognized under the installment sale rules. (See chapter 14, Sale of property, for details.) If the lease is treated as a sale on the date the lease is entered into, rather than the date the option is exercised, there may be unwanted tax consequences for the landlord. The payments that the landlord receives will be proceeds from the sale of property, and he or she will report the gain on the installment method. The landlord may also have to report imputed interest income (see chapter 12, Other income). Consequently, the landlord might have more income and fewer deductions than expected."
418,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,Other Expenses,EY,TAXPLANNER,"The rules in this area are complex, but a careful drafting of a property agreement will reduce or eliminate the likelihood that the IRS will consider the lease a sale. Professional help should be obtained."
419,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,Other Expenses,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Rental of property. You can deduct the rent you pay for property that you use for rental purposes. If you buy a leasehold for rental purposes, you can deduct an equal part of the cost each year over the term of the lease."
420,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,Other Expenses,EY,EXAMPLES,"Example 1 If you pay $1,100 rent for property and collect $1,200 in rent from a third party for the same property, you may deduct the $1,100 you pay. Your profit from the rental activity is $100. Example 2 If you buy a 10-year lease on property from someone for $1,000, you have to pay the rent that the former owner of the lease had to pay. In turn, you report as income any rent you receive on the property. You may amortize the cost of the lease over 10 years, deducting $100 each year."
421,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,Other Expenses,EY,Records,"To deduct travel expenses, you must keep records that follow the rules in chapter 27."
422,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,Other Expenses,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Travel expenses. You can deduct the ordinary and necessary expenses of traveling away from home if the primary purpose of the trip is to collect rental income or to manage, conserve, or maintain your rental property. You must properly allocate your expenses between rental and nonrental activities. You cannot deduct the cost of traveling away from home if the primary purpose of the trip was to improve your property. You recover the cost of improvements by taking depreciation. For information on travel expenses, see chapter 27. See Rental Expenses in Publication 527 for more information."
423,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Repairs and Improvements,Other Expenses,EY,TAXORGANIZER,"Be sure to keep a detailed diary of expenses for your rental property. Include the following: ·    Date and amount paid for maintenance expenses ·    Travel expenses to and from rental property (keep track of number of miles driven, including the beginning and ending odometer readings and date of travel, or actual car expenses) ·    Amount of tax return preparation fee paid for rental income portion of return (have your tax preparer show the amount separately on his or her invoice)"
424,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Property Changed To Rental Use,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you change your home or other property (or a part of it) to rental use at any time other than the beginning of your tax year, you must divide yearly expenses, such as taxes and insurance, between rental use and personal use. You can deduct as rental expenses only the part of the expense that is for the part of the year the property was used or held for rental purposes. You cannot deduct depreciation or insurance for the part of the year the property was held for personal use. However, you can include the home mortgage interest, qualified mortgage insurance premiums, and real estate tax expenses for the part of the year the property was held for personal use as an itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040). Example Your tax year is the calendar year. You moved from your home in May and started renting it out on June 1. You can deduct as rental expenses seven-twelfths of your yearly expenses, such as taxes and insurance. Starting with June, you can deduct as rental expenses the amounts you pay for items generally billed monthly, such as utilities."
425,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Renting Part of Property,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you rent part of your property, you must divide certain expenses between the part of the property used for rental purposes and the part of the property used for personal purposes, as though you actually had two separate pieces of property. You can deduct the expenses related to the part of the property used for rental purposes, such as home mortgage interest, qualified mortgage insurance premiums, and real estate taxes, as rental expenses on Schedule E (Form 1040). You can also deduct as rental expenses a portion of other expenses that normally are nondeductible personal expenses, such as expenses for electricity or painting the outside of your house. There is no change in the types of expenses deductible for the personal-use part of your property. Generally, these expenses may be deducted only if you itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). You cannot deduct any part of the cost of the first phone line even if your tenants have unlimited use of it. You do not have to divide the expenses that belong only to the rental part of your property. For example, if you paint a room that you rent, or if you pay premiums for liability insurance in connection with renting a room in your home, your entire cost is a rental expense. If you install a second phone line strictly for your tenants’ use, all of the cost of the second line is deductible as a rental expense. You can deduct depreciation, discussed later, on the part of the house used for rental purposes as well as on the furniture and equipment you use for rental purposes."
426,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Renting Part of Property,,EY,EXAMPLE,"Allison rents a room in her house to Gladys. Every year Allison has the house, including Gladys’ room, painted for maintenance purposes. The portion of the paint and labor cost for the rented room is deducted on Schedule E. The portion that does not relate to the rented room is not deductible. Allison pays mortgage interest and property taxes each year on this home. A percentage of the interest and tax that relates to the rental is deductible on Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss, and the remaining amount is deductible as an itemized deduction on Schedule A, Itemized Deductions."
427,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Renting Part of Property,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"How to divide expenses. If an expense is for both rental use and personal use, such as mortgage interest or heat for the entire house, you must divide the expense between the rental use and the personal use. You can use any reasonable method for dividing the expense. It may be reasonable to divide the cost of some items (for example, water) based on the number of people using them. The two most common methods for dividing an expense are based on (1) the number of rooms in your home, and (2) the square footage of your home."
428,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Renting Part of Property,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"As there are various methods of dividing expenses, you should use whichever “reasonable” method provides the best result. For more information, see How to Divide Expenses, later in this chapter."
429,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Not Rented for Profit,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you do not rent your property to make a profit, you can deduct your rental expenses only up to the amount of your rental income. You cannot deduct a loss or carry forward to the next year any rental expenses that are more than your rental income for the year. For more information about the rules for an activity not engaged in for profit, see Not-for-Profit Activities in chapter 1 of Publication 535. Where to report. Report your not-for-profit rental income on Form 1040, line 21. For example, you can include your mortgage interest and any qualified mortgage insurance premiums (if you use the property as your main home or second home), real estate taxes, and casualty losses on the appropriate lines of Schedule A (Form 1040) if you itemize your deductions. If you itemize your deductions, claim your other rental expenses, subject to the rules explained in chapter 1 of Publication 535, as miscellaneous itemized deductions on Form 1040, Schedule A. You can deduct these expenses only if they, together with certain other miscellaneous itemized deductions, total more than 2% of your adjusted gross income."
430,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Not Rented for Profit,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"If you move out of your personal residence and rent it, your deductions for real estate tax and mortgage interest are shifted from itemized deductions on Schedule A to rental deductions on Schedule E of Form 1040. The only additional deductions you become entitled to are those for operating expenses and depreciation. Since the rental income is included in your gross income, and the amount of additional deductions you are entitled to may be small, renting out your personal residence could increase your taxable income. If you rent out your personal residence with the intention of returning to live in it in the future, a special rule governing the deduction of mortgage interest may benefit you. See Passive Activity Limits later in this chapter."
431,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you have any personal use of a dwelling unit (including a vacation home) that you rent, you must divide your expenses between rental use and personal use. In general, your rental expenses will be no more than your total expenses multiplied by a fraction; the denominator of which is the total number of days the dwelling unit is used and the numerator of which is the total number of days actually rented at a fair rental price. Only your rental expenses may be deducted on Schedule E (Form 1040). Some of your personal expenses may be deductible if you itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). You must also determine if the dwelling unit is considered a home. The amount of rental expenses that you can deduct may be limited if the dwelling unit is considered a home. Whether a dwelling unit is considered a home depends on how many days during the year are considered to be days of personal use. There is a special rule if you used the dwelling unit as a home and you rented it for less than 15 days during the year."
432,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),,EY,TAXSAVER,"This is one of the very few instances in which the IRS considers income to be nontaxable. You should be on the lookout for opportunities to rent property for less than 15 days to take advantage of this tax loophole. Residents of Augusta,  Georgia, for example, have an annual opportunity to rent their houses for a short period during the Masters golf tournament. Explanation In general, the tax rules governing the rental of vacation homes and other dwelling units are the same as those governing any rental property. The allowable methods of depreciation, the types of deductible expenditures, and the types of expenditures that should be capitalized are all determined in the same way for both categories of rental property. However, if you or a member of your family uses the vacation home or dwelling unit during the year, the amount of deductible expenses may be limited by special rules. Here's an easy way to figure out whether or not you have to follow the special rules for reporting rental income outlined later: Step 1. Determine the number of days the property was rented at fair market value during the year. If this number is less than 15, STOP. You may not deduct any rental expenses, and you do not report any rental income. (Note: You may always deduct qualified residence interest, taxes, casualty losses, and theft losses if you itemize deductions. To do so, simply take the deduction for the entire amount of these items on Schedule A of Form 1040.) If the number of days rented is 15 or more, you must report rental income. Proceed to Step 2. Step 2. Determine the number of days you personally use the property. If this number does not exceed the greater of (a) 14 days or (b) 10% of the number of days for which the property was rented at fair market value, you are not subject to any special rules. After completing Step 3, you determine your rental income or loss in the same way you would for any type of rental property. If your personal use of the property exceeds the limits described earlier, you are subject to special rules limiting the amount of deductible expenses. After completing Step 3, you determine your rental income or loss using the rules discussed in this section. Step 3. Allocate all expenses between the rental period and the period in which you use the property personally, using the method described in the following section. Expenses allocated to the period of personal use are not deductible, except for interest, taxes, and casualty and theft losses (see Step 1). Then determine your rental income or loss, using either the general rules for rental property or the special rules regarding the personal use of vacation homes, whichever is appropriate. Note: See What Is a Day of Personal Use?, later, regarding use of a home before or after renting."
433,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Dwelling unit. A dwelling unit includes a house, apartment, condominium, mobile home, boat, vacation home, or similar property. It also includes all structures or other property belonging to the dwelling unit. A dwelling unit has basic living accommodations, such as sleeping space, a toilet, and cooking facilities. A dwelling unit does not include property used solely as a hotel, motel, inn, or similar establishment. Property is used solely as a hotel, motel, inn, or similar establishment if it is regularly available for occupancy by paying customers and is not used by an owner as a home during the year. Example. You rent a room in your home that is always available for short-term occupancy by paying customers. You do not use the room yourself, and you allow only paying customers to use the room. The room is used solely as a hotel, motel, inn, or similar establishment and is not a dwelling unit."
434,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),,EY,EXPLANATION,"A dwelling unit must provide basic living accommodations, such as sleeping space, a rest room, and cooking facilities. The Tax Court has ruled that a mini-motor home qualifies as a dwelling unit. An outbuilding used in conjunction with the main building to provide living accommodations, such as a garage, a barn, or a greenhouse, constitutes part of the main dwelling unit. When renting one of these outbuildings, you may deduct expenses only to the extent you have income. You may not deduct a rental loss because the outbuilding is not considered separate from the main building that is being used as a personal residence or vacation home. Rental pools and time-shares. Rental pools are agreements under which two or more vacation homes are made available for rent by their owners, who agree to share “at least substantially part of the rental income from the homes regardless [of] which of the vacation homes are actually rented.” Under proposed IRS regulations, special rules apply when you are computing income, expense, and personal use days. Also, under proposed IRS regulations, individuals owning a time-share that they rent are to treat their rental income and expense separately with respect to their unit. Consult your tax advisor."
435,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),Dividing Expenses,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you use a dwelling unit for both rental and personal purposes, divide your expenses between the rental use and the personal use based on the number of days used for each purpose. When dividing your expenses, follow these rules. §  Any day that the unit is rented at a fair rental price is a day of rental use even if you used the unit for personal purposes that day. This rule does not apply when determining whether you used the unit as a home. §  Any day that the unit is available for rent but not actually rented is not a day of rental use. Example. Your beach cottage was available for rent from June 1 through August 31 (92 days). During that time, except for the first week in August (7 days) when you were unable to find a renter, you rented the cottage at a fair rental price. The person who rented the cottage for July allowed you to use it over the weekend (2 days) without any reduction in or refund of rent. Your family also used the cottage during the last 2 weeks of May (14 days). The cottage was not used at all before May 17 or after August 31. You figure the part of the cottage expenses to treat as rental expenses as follows. §  The cottage was used for rental a total of 85 days (92 – 7). The days it was available for rent but not rented (7 days) are not days of rental use. The July weekend (2 days) you used it is rental use because you received a fair rental price for the weekend. §  You used the cottage for personal purposes for 14 days (the last 2 weeks in May). §  The total use of the cottage was 99 days (14 days personal use + 85 days rental use). §  Your rental expenses are 85/99 (86%) of the cottage expenses. Note. When determining whether you used the cottage as a home, the July weekend (2 days) you used it is considered personal use even though you received a fair rental price for the weekend. Therefore, you had 16 days of personal use and 83 days of rental use for this purpose. Because you used the cottage for personal purposes more than 14 days and more than 10% of the days of rental use (8 days), you used it as a home. If you have a net loss, you may not be able to deduct all of the rental expenses. See Dwelling Unit Used as a Home, next."
436,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),Dividing Expenses,EY,TAXSAVER,"The Tax Court allows you to use a different allocation formula for interest and taxes than the one the IRS describes. Under the Tax Court formula, interest and taxes are allocated in the ratio of days rented to days in the year instead of in the ratio of days rented to days used. Using the Tax Court ratio results in a smaller amount of interest and taxes being allocated to the rental property, which creates the potential for you to deduct a larger amount of your other rental expenses. Example You own a cabin, which you rented for June and July, lived in for 1 month, and tried to rent the rest of the year. Your rental income for the 2 months was $2,800. Your total expenses for the cabin were as follows:"
437,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),Dividing Expenses,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Interest $1,500 Taxes 900 Utilities 750 Maintenance 300 Depreciation 1,200 <INSERT FIGURE> [c09t001.tif] Both the IRS method and the Tax Court method allocate interest expense and real estate taxes partly to Schedule E (for determining net rental income) and partly to Schedule A (for personal itemized deductions). But examine how these allocations affect Schedule A. Total interest paid is $1,500. Since the IRS method allocates $1,005 to the rental activity, the $495 balance is allocated to Schedule A. The Tax Court method allocates only $251 to the rental activity, leaving $1,249 for a deduction on Schedule A. Similarly, the IRS method allocates $603 of the $900 in real estate taxes to the rental activity, leaving $297 for Schedule A. The Tax Court method allocates only $150 to the rental activity, leaving $750 for Schedule A."
438,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),Dividing Expenses,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Schedule A Deduction    Tax Court method IRS method Additional itemized per Tax Court method Interest $1,249 $495 $754 Real estate taxes 750 297 453    $1,207 Under the Tax Court method, you end up with additional deductions of $1,207, but you also have an additional net rental income of $891. The difference is that you reduce your taxable income by $316 more than under the IRS method. This conclusion assumes that you had enough other itemized deductions to make itemizing worthwhile and that your itemized deductions are not being limited. The concept illustrated here is also important because rental income is considered to be passive income and, as such, can be used to offset passive losses. For more details, see chapter 24, Interest expense."
439,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),Dwelling Unit Used as a Home,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you use a dwelling unit for both rental and personal purposes, the tax treatment of the rental expenses you figured earlier under Dividing Expenses and the rental income depends on whether you are considered to be using the dwelling unit as a home.

See What is a day of personal use?, later. Fair rental price. A fair rental price for your property generally is the amount of rent that a person who is not related to you would be willing to pay. The rent you charge is not a fair rental price if it is substantially less than the rents charged for other properties that are similar to your property in your area. If a dwelling unit is used for personal purposes on a day it is rented at a fair rental price, do not count that day as a day of rental use in applying (2) just described.

According to IRS Publication 527, Residential Rental Property (Including Rental of Vacation Homes), you should ask yourself the following questions to determine if another property is similar and the rent you charge is fair: (1) are they used for the same purpose? (2) are they approximately the same size? (3) are they in approximately the same condition? (4) do they have similar furnishings? and (5) are they in similar locations?"

However, see Days used as a main home before or after renting, later. 2.    A member of your family or a member of the family of any other person who owns an interest in the unit, unless the family member uses the dwelling unit as his or her main home and pays a fair rental price. Family includes only your spouse, brothers and sisters, half-brothers and half-sisters, ancestors (parents, grandparents, etc.), and lineal descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.). 3.    Anyone under an arrangement that lets you use some other dwelling unit. 4.    Anyone at less than a fair rental price."

Donation of use of property. You use a dwelling unit for personal purposes if: §  You donate the use of the unit to a charitable organization, §  The organization sells the use of the unit at a fund-raising event, and §  The “purchaser” uses the unit."

See chapter 25, Contributions, for further details on donating your property. You cannot deduct the value of the personal use, or lost rental income, as a charitable deduction."
445,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),What Is a Day of Personal Use?,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Examples. The following examples show how to determine days of personal use. Example 1. You and your neighbor are co-owners of a condominium at the beach. Last year, you rented the unit to vacationers whenever possible. The unit was not used as a main home by anyone. Your neighbor used the unit for 2 weeks last year; you did not use it at all. Because your neighbor has an interest in the unit, both of you are considered to have used the unit for personal purposes during those 2 weeks. Example 2. You and your neighbors are co-owners of a house under a shared equity financing agreement. Your neighbors live in the house and pay you a fair rental price. Even though your neighbors have an interest in the house, the days your neighbors live there are not counted as days of personal use by you. This is because your neighbors rent the house as their main home under a shared equity financing agreement. Example 3. You own a rental property that you rent to your son. Your son does not own any interest in this property. He uses it as his main home and pays you a fair rental price. Your son's use of the property is not personal use by you because your son is using it as his main home, he owns no interest in the property, and he is paying you a fair rental price. Example 4. You rent your beach house to Joshua. Joshua rents his cabin in the mountains to you. You each pay a fair rental price. You are using your house for personal purposes on the days that Joshua uses it because your house is used by Joshua under an arrangement that allows you to use his house. Example 5. You rent an apartment to your mother at less than a fair rental price. You are using the apartment for personal purposes on the days that your mother rents it because you rent it for less than a fair rental price. Days used for repairs and maintenance. Any day that you spend working substantially full time repairing and maintaining (not improving) your property is not counted as a day of personal use. Do not count such a day as a day of personal use even if family members use the property for recreational purposes on the same day."
446,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),What Is a Day of Personal Use?,EY,EXPLANATION,"If the dwelling unit is rented and you are a guest of the occupant for a brief visit, this will not constitute personal use. Of course, the longer the visit is, the more likely the IRS is to claim you were an occupant rather than a visitor. Certainly, 1 or 2 days should be no problem."
447,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),What Is a Day of Personal Use?,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Days used as a main home before or after renting. For purposes of determining whether a dwelling unit was used as a home, you may not have to count days you used the property as your main home before or after renting it or offering it for rent as days of personal use. Do not count them as days of personal use if: §  You rented or tried to rent the property for 12 or more consecutive months. §  You rented or tried to rent the property for a period of less than 12 consecutive months and the period ended because you sold or exchanged the property. However, this special rule does not apply when dividing expenses between rental and personal use. Examples. The following examples show how to determine whether you used your rental property as a home. Example 1. You converted the basement of your home into an apartment with a bedroom, a bathroom, and a small kitchen. You rented the basement apartment at a fair rental price to college students during the regular school year. You rented to them on a 9-month lease (273 days). You figured 10% of the total days rented to others at a fair rental price is 27 days. During June (30 days), your brothers stayed with you and lived in the basement apartment rent free. Your basement apartment was used as a home because you used it for personal purposes for 30 days. Rent-free use by your brothers is considered personal use. Your personal use (30 days) is more than the greater of 14 days or 10% of the total days it was rented (27 days). Example 2. You rented the guest bedroom in your home at a fair rental price during the local college's homecoming, commencement, and football weekends (a total of 27 days). Your sister-in-law stayed in the room, rent free, for the last 3 weeks (21 days) in July. You figured 10% of the total days rented to others at a fair rental price is 3 days. The room was used as a home because you used it for personal purposes for 21 days. That is more than the greater of 14 days or 10% of the 27 days it was rented (3 days). Example 3. You own a condominium apartment in a resort area. You rented it at a fair rental price for a total of 170 days during the year. For 12 of those days, the tenant was not able to use the apartment and allowed you to use it even though you did not refund any of the rent. Your family actually used the apartment for 10 of those days. Therefore, the apartment is treated as having been rented for 160 (170 − 10) days. You figured 10% of the total days rented to others at a fair rental price is 16 days. Your family also used the apartment for 7 other days during the year. You used the apartment as a home because you used it for personal purposes for 17 days. That is more than the greater of 14 days or 10% of the 160 days it was rented (16 days). Minimal rental use. If you use the dwelling unit as a home and you rent it less than 15 days during the year, that period is not treated as rental activity. See Used as a home but rented less than 15 days, later, for more information. Limit on deductions. Renting a dwelling unit that is considered a home is not a passive activity. Instead, if your rental expenses are more than your rental income, some or all of the excess expenses cannot be used to offset income from other sources. The excess expenses that cannot be used to offset income from other sources are carried forward to the next year and treated as rental expenses for the same property. Any expenses carried forward to the next year will be subject to any limits that apply for that year. This limitation will apply to expenses carried forward to another year even if you do not use the property as your home for that subsequent year.

If you do not use a dwelling unit for personal purposes, see How To Report Rental Income and Expenses, later, for how to report your rental income and expenses. Property used for personal purposes. If you do use a dwelling unit for personal purposes, then how you report your rental income and expenses depends on whether you used the dwelling unit as a home. Not used as a home. If you use a dwelling unit for personal purposes, but not as a home, report all the rental income in your income. Since you used the dwelling unit for personal purposes, you must divide your expenses between the rental use and the personal use as described earlier in Dividing Expenses.

Used as a home but rented less than 15 days. If you use a dwelling unit as a home and you rent it less than 15 days during the year, its primary function is not considered to be rental and it should not be reported on Schedule E (Form 1040). You are not required to report the rental income and rental expenses from this activity. The expenses, including qualified mortgage interest, property taxes, and any qualified casualty loss will be reported as normally allowed on Schedule A (Form 1040).

Since you used the dwelling unit for personal purposes, you must divide your expenses between the rental use and the personal use as described earlier in Dividing Expenses. The expenses for personal use are not deductible as rental expenses. If you had a net profit from renting the dwelling unit for the year (that is, if your rental income is more than the total of your rental expenses, including depreciation), deduct all of your rental expenses. You do not need to use Worksheet 9.1. However, if you had a net loss from renting the dwelling unit for the year, your deduction for certain rental expenses is limited. To figure your deductible rental expenses and any carryover to next year, use Worksheet 9-2."
449,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),Reporting Income and Deductions,EY,EXPLANATION,"The IRS explanation on reporting income and deductions for property used for personal purposes is correct as far as it goes. However, four areas require clarification: 1. The starting point in determining your rental income is gross rental income, which is defined by the IRS as the gross rent received less expenses incurred to obtain tenants, such as advertising and real estate agents’ fees. This definition is important because it enables you to deduct this type of expense before taking deductions for interest, taxes, and casualty losses, which might be enough to reduce your rental income to zero. The result may be a larger total deduction. The key point is: Start with gross rent received, deduct your expenses to obtain tenants, and then proceed through the deduction process described earlier. 2. The total amount of a casualty or theft loss allocated to the rental period is deductible. Ordinarily, a personal casualty or theft loss is deductible only to the extent that it is more than $100 and more than 10% of your adjusted gross income, but this is not the case when you are dealing with rental property. Your loss in this case would not be subject to the $100 or 10% floor limitation. (See chapter 26, Casualty and theft losses, for further details.) 3. Your basis in the vacation home or other dwelling unit is reduced only by the amount of depreciation actually allowed as a deduction, not by the amount of depreciation allocated to the rental period. This, in effect, decreases any gain you have to recognize if you subsequently sell the property. For more details on sales of depreciable assets, see Depreciation, later in this chapter. 4. Although the deductions for operating expenses and depreciation may not reduce income below zero, the deductions for interest and real estate taxes may."
450,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Personal Use of Dwelling Unit (Including Vacation Home),Reporting Income and Deductions,EY,TAXSAVER,"When you personally use a dwelling unit for more than 14 days or more than 10% of the number of days it is rented at fair market value, it is generally to your advantage to use the Tax Court formula, described earlier in Dividing Expenses, for computing the amount of interest and taxes allocable to the rental period. Doing so usually allows you a greater total deduction, because interest, taxes, and casualty losses may be deducted on Schedule A, even if they are disallowed on Schedule E. However, when your personal use of the dwelling is less than both 15 days and 10% of the number of days it is rented at fair market value, it is to your advantage to use the IRS method of allocating interest and taxes, described earlier in Dividing Expenses, because the net loss on the rental property will be allowed if your personal use is not substantial. (This assumes that the passive loss rules will not limit your net loss.) In this case, the IRS method does not reduce your total deduction; instead, it decreases your rental income (or increases your rental loss) and hence decreases your adjusted gross income. Decreasing your adjusted gross income can be important, for the following reasons: 1. The amounts of certain itemized deductions, such as medical expenses, casualty losses, and most miscellaneous itemized deductions, are determined by reference to your adjusted gross income. Decreasing your adjusted gross income potentially increases your itemized deductions for these items. 2. Many states use adjusted gross income as the starting point in computing state taxable income. Using the IRS method may reduce your state tax liability. 3. If you are subject to alternative minimum tax, this method will reduce your alternative minimum taxable income. 4. A reduction in adjusted gross income may reduce the taxable amount of social security payments. 5. If you are a participant in a qualified pension plan, a decrease in your adjusted gross income may allow you to deduct contributions to an IRA."
451,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Tangible Property Regulations,,EY,TAXALERT,"Generally, the tax law allows you to deduct expenses to repair or maintain your rental property. However, the tax law also requires you to capitalize the costs to acquire, produce, and improve tangible rental property. For tax years beginning after 2013, The IRS has issued specific guidance—called the tangible property regulations—on whether certain costs are currently deductible or must be capitalized. These regulations are applicable to tax years beginning after 2013. See chapter 48, Rules for expensing and capitalizing tangible property used in business, for a discussion about these rules."
452,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Depreciation,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"You recover the cost of income-producing property through yearly tax deductions. You do this by depreciating the property; that is, by deducting some of the cost each year on your tax return. Three factors determine how much depreciation you can deduct each year: (1) your basis in the property, (2) the recovery period for the property, and (3) the depreciation method used. You cannot simply deduct your mortgage or principal payments, or the cost of furniture, fixtures, and equipment, as an expense. You can deduct depreciation only on the part of your property used for rental purposes. Depreciation reduces your basis for figuring gain or loss on a later sale or exchange. You may have to use Form 4562 to figure and report your depreciation. See How To Report Rental Income and Expenses, later. Alternative minimum tax (AMT). If you use accelerated depreciation, you may be subject to the AMT. Accelerated depreciation allows you to deduct more depreciation earlier in the recovery period than you could deduct using a straight line method (same deduction each year)."
453,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Depreciation,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Form 6251, Alternative Minimum Tax—Individuals, is the tax form used to determine if you are subject to alternative minimum tax (AMT). The depreciation method and the useful life for depreciating property used as a rental property may be different for AMT purposes. As a result, if you own rental property and are depreciating the property, more than likely you will have an adjustment to make for AMT purposes. See chapter 31, How to figure your tax, and the IRS instructions for Form 6251 for more information."
454,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Depreciation,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Claiming the correct amount of depreciation. You should claim the correct amount of depreciation each tax year. If you did not claim all the depreciation you were entitled to deduct, you must still reduce your basis in the property by the full amount of depreciation that you could have deducted."
455,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Depreciation,,EY,EXAMPLE,"Barbara makes improvements in the amount of $10,000 to her rental property. These improvements are capitalized and depreciated over time. In the first year the improvements are put in service, Barbara does not deduct the correct amount of depreciation. She deducts $100 and reduces her basis by that amount, when the actual depreciation amount allowable is $200. If Barbara sells the property at the beginning of the next year, her basis in the property would be $9,800 (not $9,900). This is because even though Barbara only deducted $100 as depreciation, she was allowed to take a depreciation deduction of $200 and her adjusted basis should reflect the correct amount of depreciation that should have been taken."
456,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Depreciation,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you deducted an incorrect amount of depreciation for property in any year, you may be able to make a correction by filing Form 1040X, Amended U.S Individual Income Tax Return. If you are not allowed to make the correction on an amended return, you can change your accounting method to claim the correct amount of depreciation. See Claiming the correct amount of depreciation in chapter 2 of Publication 527 for more information. Changing your accounting method to deduct unclaimed depreciation. To change your accounting method, you generally must file Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method, to get the consent of the IRS. In some instances, that consent is automatic. For more information, see chapter 1 of Publication 946. Land. You cannot depreciate the cost of land because land generally does not wear out, become obsolete, or get used up. The costs of clearing, grading, planting, and landscaping are usually all part of the cost of land and cannot be depreciated."
457,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Depreciation,,EY,EXPLANATION,"When calculating your depreciation expense, be sure to separate out the cost of land from the cost of the building because land is not depreciable. Taxpayers often forget to separate these costs, and, therefore, the true adjusted basis of the building is often not reflected. These amounts are normally not allocated on your purchase agreement so you must get an estimate of the value of the land by a real estate broker or by your county. For further details, consult your tax advisor."
458,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Depreciation,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,More information. See Publication 527 for more information about depreciating rental property and see Publication 946 for more information about depreciation.
459,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Depreciation,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Depreciation may perhaps be best understood as a way of deducting the cost of an expenditure over many years. Depreciation is calculated in the same way whether you report income on the cash or the accrual method. The period of time over which you depreciate your property has long been the subject of controversy. Different taxpayers, often in the same business, have depreciated the same type of property over widely different periods. Efforts to bring more uniformity to the write-off period resulted in the introduction of the Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS). ACRS was replaced with MACRS (Modified ACRS) by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Most tangible personal property can be depreciated. Artwork is an exception. It cannot be depreciated because no useful life can be established. Under current law, leasehold improvements must be depreciated under MACRS. While MACRS generally requires you to depreciate an addition or improvement to nonresidential real property placed in service after May 12, 1993, over a 39-year period using the straight-line method, a 2004 tax provision allows qualified leasehold improvements placed in service after October 22, 2004 to be depreciated using the straight-line method over a 15-year recovery period. Qualified improvements are any improvements to an interior portion of a building that is non-residential real property provided: ·    The improvement is made under a lease either by the lessee (or sub-lessee), or by the lessor, of that portion of the building to be occupied exclusively by the lessee (or sub-lessee); ·    The improvement is placed in service more than 3 years after the date the building was first placed in service; and ·    The improvement is not attributable to the enlargement of the building, any elevator or escalator, any structural component benefiting a common area, or the internal structural framework of the building."
460,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Depreciation,,EY,TAXSAVER,"50% Bonus depreciation available through 2019. Under Section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, you are also allowed to take bonus depreciation for qualified property, including qualified leasehold improvements, acquired and placed in service during 2015 through 2019. Bonus depreciation is 50% for property placed in service during 2015, 2016 and 2017. It decreases to 40% in 2018, and 30% in 2019."
461,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Depreciation,,EY,TAXSAVER,"Expensing certain assets (Section 179 deduction). You can elect to deduct all or part of the cost, up to specified limits, of certain qualifying property, including qualified leasehold improvements, in the year in which the property is purchased, rather than capitalizing the cost and depreciating it over its life. This means that you can deduct all or part of the cost up front in one year rather than take depreciation deductions spread out over many years. You must decide for each item of qualifying property whether to deduct, subject to the yearly limit, or capitalize and depreciate its cost. Qualifying property is property purchased for use in your trade or business and property that would have qualified for the investment tax credit. Starting in 2016, investments in air conditioning and heating units are also treated as qualifying property. Specified limits. The maximum Section 179 deduction available for qualifying property placed into service during 2016 is $500,000. (For 2015, the limit on qualified leasehold improvement property was $250,000; this $250,000 limitation was eliminated beginning in 2016.) The allowable deduction is reduced dollar for dollar once the cost of qualifying property placed into service during 2016 exceeds $2,010,000. These amounts are indexed annually for inflation. Basis of qualifying property. The amount you elect to deduct is subtracted from the basis of the qualifying property. If you elect the Section 179 deduction, the amount of your allowable ACRS or MACRS deduction for this property will be reduced. If you and your spouse file separate returns in 2016, you can each deduct only $250,000, unless you and your spouse agree on a different split of the $500,000. Other restrictions. The amount of the Section 179 deduction cannot be greater than the income derived from the active conduct by the taxpayer of any business during such taxable year (computed without regard to the property to be expensed). This rule prevents you from generating or adding to a net operating loss due to the Section 179 expense. Any Section 179 deductions disallowed under this income limitation are carried forward to the succeeding taxable year and added to the allowable amount for such year. Therefore, in the following year, you are eligible to receive the deduction ($500,000 in 2017) plus the carryover from the preceding year, limited to the amount of income. Cost. The cost of property for the Section 179 deduction does not include any part of the basis of the property that is determined by reference to the basis of other property held at any time by the person acquiring this property. For example, if you buy a new truck to use in your business, your cost for purposes of the Section 179 deduction does not include the adjusted basis of the truck you trade in on the new vehicle. Example. You buy a new piece of equipment, paying $2,500 cash and trading in your old equipment, which had an undepreciated cost to you of $4,000. Even though the new equipment has a tax basis to you of $6,500, you may claim the Section 179 deduction only on the $2,500 you paid out. When to elect. You must make an election to take the Section 179 deduction, which can only be made in the first tax year in which the property is placed in service. If you elect to deduct the cost of qualifying property, you must specify the items to which the election applies and the part of the cost of each you elect to deduct. If in 2016 you purchase and place in service two items of qualifying property costing $350,000 and $250,000, and you want to elect the $500,000 deduction, you must specify what part of the $350,000 property and the $250,000 property you want to deduct. You may arbitrarily allocate the maximum $500,000 between the two properties. Your remaining basis of $100,000 ($600,000 total cost of property placed in service, less $500,000 maximum Section 179 expense) may be depreciated. Use Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization, to make the election and report the Section 179 deduction. The election is made by taking the deduction on Form 4562, filed with your original tax return. The election can be made on an amended tax return filed after the due date (including extensions), and can be revoked as long as the statute of limitations for the return is still open. Consult your tax advisor regarding the Section 179 rules."
462,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Depreciation,,EY,TAXORGANIZER,"Make sure to keep track of all assets acquired and improvements made related to your rental properties. You should keep records of cost, depreciation method, and amount of depreciation already taken. Therefore, if any of these assets are sold, it will be easier to calculate the gain and depreciation recapture amount, if necessary."
463,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Depreciation,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Gain from disposition. If you dispose of depreciable property at a gain, you may have to report, as ordinary income, all or part of the gain. See Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets. When you sell an asset for more than your unrecovered cost, you face the problem of depreciation recapture, that is, reporting all or part of your gain as ordinary income as opposed to capital gain. If you sell tangible personal property at a gain, your recapture is the lower of your gain or the previous amount of depreciation. Example"

However, a 25% capital gains tax rate, as opposed to the more favorable 0%, 15%, or 20% capital gains tax rates that generally apply to long-term capital gains (see chapter 16, Reporting gains and losses, for more information) may apply to depreciation recapture on real property."
465,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Depreciation,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Because the maximum tax rate on ordinary income in 2016 is 39.6% and the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains is 20% (for taxable income in excess of $415,050 for single filers and $466,950 for married filing jointly filers), the depreciation recaptured may be taxed at a higher rate at the time of the sale."
466,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Limits on Rental Losses,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you have a loss from your rental real estate activity, two sets of rules may limit the amount of loss you can deduct. You must consider these rules in the order shown below. 1.    At-risk rules. These rules are applied first if there is investment in your rental real estate activity for which you are not at risk. This applies only if the real property was placed in service after 1986. 2.    Passive activity limits. Generally, rental real estate activities are considered passive activities and losses are not deductible unless you have income from other passive activities to offset them. However, there are exceptions."
467,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Limits on Rental Losses,At-Risk Rules,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"You may be subject to the at-risk rules if you have: §  A loss from an activity carried on as a trade or business or for the production of income, and §  Amounts invested in the activity for which you are not fully at risk. Losses from holding real property (other than mineral property) placed in service before 1987 are not subject to the at-risk rules. In most cases, any loss from an activity subject to the at-risk rules is allowed only to the extent of the total amount you have at risk in the activity at the end of the tax year. You are considered at risk in an activity to the extent of cash and the adjusted basis of other property you contributed to the activity and certain amounts borrowed for use in the activity. See Publication 925 for more information."

472,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Limits on Rental Losses,Passive Activity Limits,EY,EXPLANATION,"A rental activity is considered a passive activity unless you are considered a real estate professional. An activity is a rental activity if: 1. Tangible property is used by customers. 2. Income received is principally for the use of the property whether or not there is a lease, service contract, or other arrangement. An activity is not considered a rental activity if: 1. The average time the customer uses the property is 7 days or less. 2. The average time the customer uses the property is 30 days or less and personal services have been provided by the owner in connection with the rental. 3. Extraordinary personal services are provided by the owner in connection with the rental. 4. The rental of the activity is incidental to the nonrental. 5. You customarily make the rental property available during defined business hours for nonexclusive use by various customers. 6. The property is associated with a partnership, S corporation, or joint venture. Example Amy owns a time-share condo and rents it to a third party for a week each year. Amy paid for no additional services except for weekly cleaning of the unit through condominium dues. This property is not considered a rental activity."

474,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Limits on Rental Losses,Passive Activity Limits,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Exception for Rental Real Estate Activities With Active Participation If you or your spouse actively participated in a passive rental real estate activity, you may be able to deduct up to $25,000 of loss from the activity from your non passive income. This special allowance is an exception to the general rule disallowing losses in excess of income from passive activities. Similarly, you may be able to offset credits from the activity against the tax on up to $25,000 of nonpassive income after taking into account any losses allowed under this exception. Active participation. You actively participated in a rental real estate activity if you (and your spouse) owned at least 10% of the rental property and you made management decisions or arranged for others to provide services (such as repairs) in a significant and bona fide sense. Management decisions that may count as active participation include approving new tenants, deciding on rental terms, approving expenditures, and similar decisions. Maximum special allowance. The maximum special allowance is: §  $25,000 for single individuals and married individuals filing a joint return for the tax year, §  $12,500 for married individuals who file separate returns for the tax year and lived apart from their spouses at all times during the tax year, and §  $25,000 for a qualifying estate reduced by the special allowance for which the surviving spouse qualified. If your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is $100,000 or less ($50,000 or less if married filing separately), you can deduct your loss up to the amount specified above. If your MAGI is more than $100,000 (more than $50,000 if married filing separately), your special allowance is limited to 50% of the difference between $150,000 ($75,000 if married filing separately) and your MAGI. Generally, if your MAGI is $150,000 or more ($75,000 or more if you are married filing separately), there is no special allowance. More information.

Explanation You must meet the active participation standards both in the year in which the loss arose and in the year in which the loss is allowed. Losses that exceed $25,000 carried over from an active participation year can be used in a later year if the taxpayer continues to actively participate. The $25,000 offset rule does not apply to the losses carried over from prior years where the taxpayer did not actively participate in the rental."
478,Chapter 9,Rental income and expenses,Limits on Rental Losses,Passive Activity Limits,EY,TAXALERT,"A tax-saving opportunity exists depending on how personal property and real property are grouped. In general, a taxpayer may not treat as a single activity the rental of real property and the rental of personal property (other than personal property provided in connection with real property). Furthermore, taxpayers may treat as a single activity the rental of real property provided in connection with the rental of personal property. Example An individual who leases $10,000 of real property (e.g., a small structure or other fixture) in connection with renting $150,000 of computer equipment could treat as one activity the rental of both the real property and the personal property.

For starters, chances are good that you will have some difficulty projecting your tax liabilities. Your income will most likely be different from what it has been, and the way in which you calculate your tax will be different, too. you'll have to puzzle over the complicated withdrawal requirements from 401(k) and other retirement accounts. You may also be faced with the decision of whether to withdraw certain funds as an annuity, or in one lump-sum distribution. If you are entitled to any lump-sum distributions, you will have to make the difficult decision as to whether to roll over the funds and defer the tax or to pay the tax currently. If your pension payments are not subject to mandatory withholding rules, you may have to start making estimated tax payments or elect to have income taxes withheld from your pension payments. This chapter helps guide you through this maze of complicated decisions."
487,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",,,EY,Tax Breaks and Deductions You Can Use Checklist,"Excluding a rollover distribution from current taxes. If you withdraw all or a part of your balance in a qualified plan or tax-sheltered annuity arrangement, and such distribution is eligible to be rolled over to the qualified retirement plan of an employer or an IRA, you can defer tax on the distribution by contributing it to an eligible retirement plan. For more information, see Rollovers, later. Avoiding mandatory 20% withholding on eligible rollover distributions. Payers of benefits from your pension, profit-sharing, annuity, stock bonus, or other qualified deferred compensation plans are generally required to withhold 20% of distributions from such plans. However, withholding is not required on an eligible rollover distribution if you elect to have it paid directly to an IRA or qualified retirement plan of an employer. For more information, see Withholding and Estimated Tax, later. 401(k) and 403(b) plan contributions. You can reduce your taxable wages (and your tax bill) by contributing on a pre-tax basis to a 401(k) or 403(b) plan sponsored by your employer. In 2016, you could contribute up to $18,000 ($24,000 if you were 50 or older by the end of 2016). For more details, see Elective deferrals, later. Roth 401(k) plans. If your employer plan allows it, you may be able to designate part or all of your contributions to your employer's 401(k) plan as “Roth 401(k)” contributions. Unlike contributions made to a “traditional” 401(k) plan that reduce your taxable wages, contributions to a Roth 401(k) do not reduce the amount of your earnings currently subject to tax. However, if certain requirements are met, your entire plan account can be distributed to you completely tax-free. For more details, see General Information. Taxation of appreciated employer securities received as part of a lump-sum distribution. If a lump-sum distribution includes shares of stock in your employer that have appreciated in value, this “net unrealized appreciation” (NUA), which is determined upon the distribution, will not be subject to tax until you subsequently sell the shares. If the shares are sold, then the gain will be taxed as a long-term capital gain up to the amount of the NUA. Any gain in excess of the NUA will be taxed as long-term capital gain only if you hold the stock after distribution for at least 12 months prior to selling it. Alternatively, you can elect to treat the NUA as part of the lump-sum distribution subject to immediate tax. This may be desirable if you otherwise have tax losses that can offset the amount of the NUA. For more information, see Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA), later."

For more information about the General Rule, get Publication 939. Also, see Variable Annuities in Publication 575 for the special provisions that apply to these annuity contracts. Loans. If you borrow money from your retirement plan, you must treat the loan as a nonperiodic distribution from the plan unless certain exceptions apply. This treatment also applies to any loan under a contract purchased under your retirement plan, and to the value of any part of your interest in the plan or contract that you pledge or assign. This means that you must include in income all or part of the amount borrowed. Even if you do not have to treat the loan as a nonperiodic distribution, you may not be able to deduct the interest on the loan in some situations. For details, see Loans Treated as Distributions in Publication 575. For information on the deductibility of interest, see chapter 24."
505,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",General Information,,EY,EXCEPTION,"A loan will not be considered a distribution to the extent that the loan (when added to the outstanding balance of all other loans maintained by the employer) does not exceed the lesser of (1) $50,000 or (2) the greater of either $10,000 or one-half of the participant's vested accrued benefits under the plan. The $50,000 limit is reduced by the excess of the participant's highest outstanding loan balance during the preceding 12-month period, over the outstanding balance at the date of the new loan. In addition, the exception does not apply unless the loan by its terms must be repaid within 5 years and requires level repayments made not less frequently than quarterly over the term of the loan. The 5-year rule does not generally apply to loans made in connection with the purchase of a principal residence of a participant."
506,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",General Information,,EY,TAXALERT,"Interest on a loan from an employee plan is only deductible under the general loan interest rules (discussed in chapter 24, Interest expense). Even if the interest is otherwise deductible under the general rules, it will not be deductible if the loan was made to a key employee or secured by amounts attributable to an employee's salary reduction amounts. It should also be noted that personal loan interest is not deductible."
507,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",General Information,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Loans from a retirement plan may be an option to provide for your children's college expenses, a housing down payment, or any other family need. The interest you pay on the loan helps your account grow at an attractive rate if the plan credits interest paid on the loan to your account. But there are some significant risks to consider before taking such a loan. One downside is that you may earn less in your plan from this interest than you would have had you left the money in other investments. Another drawback is that any loan that is not paid back within 5 years is subject to income tax and penalties, and perhaps above all, your retirement plan is depleted. Saving for education through a 529 plan and even taking out student loans may be preferable. Elective deferrals. Some retirement plans allow you to elect to have your employer contribute part of your compensation to a retirement fund, rather than have it paid to you. You do not pay income tax on this money until you receive it in a distribution from the plan. Generally, you may not defer more than a total of $18,000 ($24,000 for individuals who have attained at least age 50 by year-end) for all qualified plans by which you are covered in 2016. Elective deferrals generally include elective contributions to cash or deferred arrangements (known as 401(k) plans) and elective contributions to Section 501(c)(18)(D) plans, salary reduction simplified employee pension (SARSEP) plans, SIMPLE plans, and 403(b) tax-sheltered annuities. Some employers offer a Roth 401(k) account as an alternative to the traditional 401(k) plan. The difference is that instead of your elective contributions being excluded from taxable wages up front and earnings on the 401(k) account being taxed upon withdrawal, your contributions to the Roth 401(k) are included as part of your taxable wages but distributions—if certain requirements are met—of both your contributions and all future earnings are completely tax-free. Certain deferrals (such as cafeteria plan contributions and qualified transportation fringe benefits) that are not included in your gross income are still included in your compensation for purposes of determining your base amount for your 401(k) contributions. For example, the amounts contributed to a cafeteria plan will not decrease the tax-deferred amount that can be contributed by the employer at the election of the employee to his or her 401(k) plan."
508,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",General Information,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"There are several special rules used to determine the limit on employee elective deferrals. If the deferrals are otherwise permitted under these special rules, there is an annual limit on elective deferrals ($18,000 for 2016 (plus an additional $6,000 for persons who have attained at least age 50 by the end of the year). This is an aggregate limit for each individual. It takes into consideration all deferrals by that individual during the year to all 401(k) plans (including Roth 401(k) accounts), 403(b) tax-sheltered annuities, SIMPLE plans, and salary reduction simplified employee pension (SARSEP) plans. (Employers that established SEPs were prohibited in 1996 from establishing any new SARSEPs—which are salary reduction SEPs—after December 31, 1996). A SEP is a special type of IRA established by an employer for all its employees. The limit on contributions to a SIMPLE plan is $12,500; so if the employee has access to only a SIMPLE plan, the employee can defer only $12,500 because the SIMPLE limit cuts off the permissible $18,000. However, if the employee moves mid-year to another employer that has a 401(k) plan, then the combined $18,000 limit applies (as long as not more than $12,500 was deferred to the SIMPLE). The limit applies even if the employee makes deferrals to plans sponsored by different employers or to different types of plans (elective contributions to Section 457 plans for government and non-profit employees are not included in this aggregation). Note that this limit is an elective contribution limit. There is also a limit on total employer contributions to qualified defined contribution plans of $53,000 in 2016; for this limit, elective deferrals are treated as employer contributions. Thus, if you are under age 50 and make the maximum deferral of $18,000 in 2016, you only have $35,000 left for other employer contributions. The dollar limit is indexed annually for inflation in $500 increments. Example Assume Steve works for Employer A from January 2016 to April 2016 and defers $5,000 to Employer A's 401(k) plan during this time. If Steve leaves in May 2016 to work for Employer B for the remainder of the year, the most Steve could defer to Employer B's 401(k) plan for the remainder of 2016 is $13,000. Alternatively, assume Steve works for Employer A from January 2016 to August 2016 and defers $7,500 to Employer A's 401(k) plan. In September, Steve leaves to work for Employer B, which sponsors a SIMPLE IRA for its employees. Steve will only be allowed to defer $10,500 to the SIMPLE IRA for 2016—$18,000 aggregate limit less $7,500 already deferred to Employer A's 401(k) plan. If instead Steve had deferred only $2,500 in Employer A's 401(k) plan, then because the elective deferral limit for a SIMPLE is $12,500, Steve would only be able to defer an additional $12,500 even though the total amount of his elective deferrals for the year is only $15,000."
509,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",General Information,,EY,TAXALERT,"If you are at least 50 years old by the end of the taxable year, you can elect to defer even more to a 401(k) plan, a 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity, a SARSEP, a SIMPLE plan, or a governmental Section 457 plan. The additional amount of elective contributions that may be made is the lesser of (1) the applicable dollar amount (as described) or (2) your compensation for the year reduced by any other elective deferrals you made for the year. The applicable dollar amount for age 50 catch-up contributions under a 401(k) plan, a 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity, a SARSEP, or a governmental Section 457 plan is $6,000 for 2016. The applicable dollar amount for the age 50 catch-up contributions under a SIMPLE plan is $3,000 for 2016."
510,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",General Information,,EY,TAXALERT,"If you realize that you made excess elective deferrals (the limit is $18,000 or, if you have attained age 50, $24,000 for 2016) in any given calendar year, be certain to notify your plan administrator(s) as soon as possible. The excess deferral amount will be taxable to you in the year of the deferral. In addition, if this excess deferral (plus earnings or losses for the year attributable to such excess deferrals) is not distributed to you by the following April 15, the excess deferral amount will again be taxed to you when it is ultimately distributed to you upon your retirement or separation from your employer. If the excess deferral is distributed to you by the following April 15, however, it will not be taxed a second time when distributed (although the income attributable to the excess deferral will be taxed to you in the year of distribution). Any earnings or losses on the excess deferral occurring after December 31 of the deferral year do not impact the amount of the distribution if the excess is distributed by April 15 of the following year; only earnings or losses on the excess deferral through December 31 of the year of deferral are distributed at this time."
511,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",General Information,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"The benefits of 401(k) plans are substantial. The elective deferrals are not subject to federal, most state, and most local income taxes until they are withdrawn. (They are subject to social security and Medicare taxes at the time of deferral, though.) Earnings on elective deferrals are also not subject to income tax until they are withdrawn. An employer matching contribution program (which is deductible to the employer within certain limits and not taxable to the employee until distributed) can encourage employees to make elective deferrals. Finally, on withdrawal, a lump-sum distribution can escape immediate income tax or excise tax if it is deposited into a rollover account. For more information, see Rollovers later in this chapter. Since 2006, the law also allows employers to offer “Roth 401(k)” plans to their employees. Under a Roth 401(k), contributions are nondeductible but all the income in the plan is tax-free if certain requirements are met at distribution. (The regular 401(k) dollar limitation applies to the combination of regular and Roth 401(k) contributions.) These requirements are similar to those that apply to Roth IRAs, which are discussed in chapter 17, Individual retirement arrangements (IRAs). However, unlike with Roth IRAs, the ability to contribute to a Roth 401(k) is not limited to those with income below certain limits."
512,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",General Information,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"403(b) plans (tax-sheltered annuity, or TSA plans), which are available to employees of certain tax-exempt organizations, to employees of educational organizations and of state and local governments, and to certain church employees, offer many of the same benefits that 401(k) plans offer. The elective deferrals are not subject to federal income tax, most state income taxes, and most local income taxes, until they are withdrawn. Earnings on elective deferrals are also not subject to income tax until they are withdrawn. Rollovers are permitted for qualifying distributions, which avoid immediate income tax or excise taxes, if applicable. Effective for distributions made after December 31, 2001, eligible rollover distributions from a TSA plan can be rolled over into a qualified retirement plan, another TSA plan, or an IRA, including a Roth IRA. Under a 2010 tax law, if the TSA has a designated Roth contribution program, amounts held inside a pre-tax account can be rolled over to a designated Roth account within the plan. (Distributions rolled over to either a designated Roth account within the TSA or to a Roth IRA are subject to special rules for rollovers to Roth IRAs from non-Roth accounts.) State and local governments (other than rural cooperative plans and, for certain employees, Indian tribal governments) cannot provide 401(k) plans to their employees, although they may offer a TSA plan for employees of certain educational organizations and they may offer Section 457 plans. For information about tax-sheltered annuities, see Publication 571, Tax-Sheltered Annuity Programs for Employees of Public Schools and Certain Tax-Exempt Organizations.

513,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",General Information,,EY,TAXSAVER,"Individuals earning limited amounts of self-employment income may be able to shelter all or a substantial portion of their income by utilizing a SIMPLE IRA. (Note: Unless you are self—employed, other than as a partner, SIMPLE IRAs may only be established by your employer.) Although an individual may only defer $12,500 in 2016 to a SIMPLE IRA, these deferrals are not limited to a certain percentage of an individual's compensation as is the case with other plans. For example, in 2016 an individual with $13,000 in self-employment income (e.g., director's fees) could defer $12,500 (or 96%) of the income into a SIMPLE IRA. In addition to the $12,500 employee deferral, either a 3% matching contribution or a 2% employer contribution would be required to satisfy the SIMPLE IRA rules. On the other hand, the same individual could contribute only 25% of the income (after reduction for the 25% contribution itself) into a SEP, or$2,600. (An even better alternative would be a Keogh/401(k) plan combination. Under that type of plan, you could contribute up to the full 401(k) limit of $18,000.)

Your total cost in the plan includes the total premiums, contributions, or other amounts you paid. This includes the amounts your employer contributed that were taxable to you when paid. Cost does not include any amounts you deducted or were excluded from your income. From this total cost, subtract any refunds of premiums, rebates, dividends, unrepaid loans that were not included in your income, or other tax-free amounts that you received by the later of the annuity starting date or the date on which you received your first payment.

You must report them on your income tax return. Partly taxable payments. If you paid part of the cost of your pension or annuity, you are not taxed on the part of the pension or annuity you receive that represents a return of your cost. The rest of the amount you receive is generally taxable. You figure the tax-free part of the payment using either the Simplified Method or the General Rule. Your annuity starting date and whether or not your plan is qualified determine which method you must or may use. If your annuity starting date is after November 18, 1996, and your payments are from a qualified plan, you must use the Simplified Method. Generally, you must use the General Rule if your annuity is paid under a nonqualified plan, and you cannot use this method if your annuity is paid under a qualified plan. If you had more than one partly taxable pension or annuity, figure the tax-free part and the taxable part of each separately. If your annuity is paid under a qualified plan and your annuity starting date is after July 1, 1986, and before November 19, 1996, you could have chosen to use either the General Rule or the Simplified Method. Exclusion limit. Your annuity starting date determines the total amount of annuity payments that you can exclude from your taxable income over the years. Once your annuity starting date is determined, it does not change. If you calculate the taxable portion of your annuity payments using the simplified method worksheet, the annuity starting date determines the recovery period for your cost. That recovery period begins on your annuity starting date and is not affected by the date you first complete the worksheet. Exclusion limited to cost. If your annuity starting date is after 1986, the total amount of annuity income that you can exclude over the years as a recovery of the cost cannot exceed your total cost. Any unrecovered cost at your (or the last annuitant's) death is allowed as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on the final return of the decedent. This deduction is not subject to the 2%-of-adjusted-gross-income limit. Exclusion not limited to cost. If your annuity starting date is before 1987, you can continue to take your monthly exclusion for as long as you receive your annuity. If you chose a joint and survivor annuity, your survivor can continue to take the survivor's exclusion figured as of the annuity starting date. The total exclusion may be more than your cost."

For information on plan contribution limits and how to report corrective distributions of excess contributions, see Retirement Plan Contributions under Employee Compensation in Publication 525. Figuring the taxable amount of nonperiodic payments. How you figure the taxable amount of a nonperiodic distribution depends on whether it is made before the annuity starting date, or on or after the annuity starting date. If it is made before the annuity starting date, its tax treatment also depends on whether it is made under a qualified or nonqualified plan.

533,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Taxation of Nonperiodic Payments,Lump-Sum Distributions,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"A lump-sum distribution is the distribution or payment in one tax year of a plan participant's entire balance from all of the employer's qualified plans of one kind (for example, pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plans). A distribution from a nonqualified plan (such as a privately purchased commercial annuity or a Section 457 deferred compensation plan of a state or local government or tax-exempt organization) cannot qualify as a lump-sum distribution. The participant's entire balance from a plan does not include certain forfeited amounts. It also does not include any deductible voluntary employee contributions allowed by the plan after 1981 and before 1987.

If an amount is transferred from one qualified plan to another, no amount will be required to be withheld on the amount transferred from your old employer's plan. While there is nothing in the law that requires your new employer to accept transferred amounts, some employers may do this as an accommodation to new employees. Plan-to-plan transfers have certain advantages over rollovers. See Rollovers, later in this chapter."
536,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Taxation of Nonperiodic Payments,Lump-Sum Distributions,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you receive a lump-sum distribution from a qualified employee plan or qualified employee annuity and the plan participant was born before January 2, 1936, you may be able to elect optional methods of figuring the tax on the distribution. The part from active participation in the plan before 1974 may qualify as capital gain subject to a 20% tax rate. The part from participation after 1973 (and any part from participation before 1974 that you do not report as capital gain) is ordinary income. You may be able to use the 10-year tax option, discussed later, to figure tax on the ordinary income part. Use Form 4972 to figure the separate tax on a lump-sum distribution using the optional methods. The tax figured on Form 4972 is added to the regular tax figured on your other income. This may result in a smaller tax than you would pay by including the taxable amount of the distribution as ordinary income in figuring your regular tax. How to treat the distribution. If you receive a lump-sum distribution, you may have the following options for how you treat the taxable part. §  Report the part of the distribution from participation before 1974 as a capital gain (if you qualify) and the part from participation after 1973 as ordinary income. §  Report the part of the distribution from participation before 1974 as a capital gain (if you qualify) and use the 10-year tax option to figure the tax on the part from participation after 1973 (if you qualify). §  Use the 10-year tax option to figure the tax on the total taxable amount (if you qualify). §  Roll over all or part of the distribution. See Rollovers, later. No tax is currently due on the part rolled over. Report any part not rolled over as ordinary income. §  Report the entire taxable part of the distribution as ordinary income on your tax return. The first three options are explained in the following discussions. Electing optional lump-sum treatment. You can choose to use the 10-year tax option or capital gain treatment only once after 1986 for any plan participant. If you make this choice, you cannot use either of these optional treatments for any future distributions for the participant. Taxable and tax-free parts of the distribution. The taxable part of a lump-sum distribution is the employer's contributions and income earned on your account. You may recover your cost in the lump sum and any net unrealized appreciation (NUA) in employer securities tax free. Cost. In general, your cost is the total of: §  The plan participant's nondeductible contributions to the plan, §  The plan participant's taxable costs of any life insurance contract distributed, §  Any employer contributions that were taxable to the plan participant, and §  Repayments of any loans that were taxable to the plan participant. You must reduce this cost by amounts previously distributed tax free. Net unrealized appreciation (NUA). The NUA in employer securities (box 6 of Form 1099-R) received as part of a lump-sum distribution is generally tax free until you sell or exchange the securities. (For more information, see Distributions of employer securities under Taxation of Nonperiodic Payments in Publication 575.)"
537,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Taxation of Nonperiodic Payments,Lump-Sum Distributions,EY,EXPLANATION,"Employer securities distributed as part of a lump-sum distribution may have increased in value after they were purchased by the trust that is making the distribution. This increase is called “net unrealized appreciation.” It is not taxed at the time of the lump-sum distribution. If you later sell these securities, any gain is taxed as a long-term capital gain (i.e., as if held for more than 12 months)—up to the amount of your net unrealized appreciation (NUA). Any gain above this amount is a long-term capital gain only if the employee holds the stock after distribution for more than 12 months prior to selling it. You may also elect not to use this treatment on your tax return and instead treat the NUA as part of your lump-sum distribution. This may be desirable if you have tax losses that can offset the amount of NUA. You may not claim a loss if you receive stock that is worth less than your total contributions to the plan. You may claim a loss when you sell the stock if it is sold for less than the amount of your own after-tax employee contributions allocated to the shares of stock sold. Example Assume that Widget Company's pension trust used the company's contribution for Sarah Jones to purchase 100 shares of Widget Company common stock at $10 per share on January 10, 2001. These securities were given to Sarah Jones as part of a lump-sum distribution on January 1, 2016, when their value had risen to $15 per share. Sarah is taxed on the $10 per share that was contributed by Widget, but she is not taxed on the NUA of $5 per share on January 1, 2016. If Sarah sold the 100 shares of Widget Company stock on January 9, 2017, for $25 per share, $500 of the gain [($15 − $10) × 100 shares] attributed to NUA would be taxed as long-term capital gain. The balance of the gain, $1,000 [($25 − $5 − $10) × 100 shares], would be taxed as a short-term capital gain, since Sarah did not hold the securities for more than 12 months from the distribution date. If Sarah had made her own after-tax contributions of $1,700 to the pension trust and received Widget Company stock valued at only $1,000 at the time of the lump-sum distribution, she could not have claimed a loss at that time. However, if she later sold the stock, she would compare her proceeds with $1,700 to determine if she had a gain or a loss on the sale."

You can elect this treatment only once for any plan participant, and only if the plan participant was born before January 2, 1936.

Then within 60 days of the distribution, (in this order) roll over the taxable amount plus other funds equal to the amount withheld to a traditional IRA, and then on the next day (or after the first rollover and before 60 days from the date of the distribution), roll the remaining amount (all basis) to the Roth IRA.

You may be able to roll over the nontaxable part of a distribution (such as your after-tax contributions) made to another qualified retirement plan that is a qualified employee plan or a 403(b) plan, or to a traditional or Roth IRA. The transfer must be made either through a direct rollover to a qualified plan or 403(b) plan that separately accounts for the taxable and nontaxable parts of the rollover or through a rollover to a traditional or Roth IRA. If you roll over only part of a distribution that includes both taxable and nontaxable amounts, the amount you roll over is treated as coming first from the taxable part of the distribution. Any after-tax contributions that you roll over into your traditional IRA become part of your basis (cost) in your IRAs. To recover your basis when you take distributions from your IRA, you must complete Form 8606 for the year of the distribution. For more information, see the Form 8606 instructions."

(If an amount distributed to you becomes a frozen deposit in a financial institution during the 60-day period after you receive it, the rollover period is extended for the period during which the distribution is in a frozen deposit in a financial institution.) The IRS may waive the 60-day requirement where the failure to do so would be against equity or good conscience, such as in the event of a casualty, disaster, or other event beyond your reasonable control.

If you are a designated beneficiary (other than a surviving spouse) of a deceased employee, you may be able to roll over tax free all or a portion of a distribution you receive from an eligible retirement plan of the employee. The distribution must be a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to your traditional or Roth IRA that was set up to receive the distribution. The transfer will be treated as an eligible rollover distribution and the receiving plan will be treated as an inherited IRA. For information on inherited IRAs, see What If You Inherit an IRA? in chapter 1 of Publication 590–B, Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)."

The same rule applies if any distribution attributable to an employee is paid to a spouse or a former spouse as an “alternate payee” under a QDRO. A distribution made to the surviving spouse of an employee (or an alternate payee under a QDRO) is an eligible rollover distribution if it meets the requirements explained earlier.

Generally, the designated beneficiary on file with your plan administrator will be treated as the beneficiary of your plan even if you have subsequently changed the beneficiary under other agreements, such as a divorce settlement. It is a good idea to review your beneficiary designations each time you have a change in family status (e.g., marriage, divorce, or birth of child). If you have not designated a beneficiary for any salary that, because of death, you will not collect, the money will generally be paid into your estate. In that case, it would be reported as income on the estate's income tax return."

Due to a 2012 tax law change, beginning in 2013, any amount in a non-Roth account can be converted to a Roth account in the same plan, whether or not the amount is otherwise eligible for distribution. This tax law significantly expanded the population of taxpayers who can take advantage of this option for converting pre-tax amounts held inside their 401(k), 403(b), and/or 457(b) plans to a Roth account. Just like a conversion to a Roth IRA (discussed in chapter 17, Individual retirement arrangements (IRAs), the amount rolled over is includible in taxable income except to the extent it includes a return of after-tax contributions."

See the earlier discussion in this chapter on Withholding and Estimated Tax."
558,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Rollovers,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"If you receive a hardship distribution and another event occurs, such as separation from your employer or attainment of age 59½, so that the distribution is permitted without regard to hardship, you should consult your plan administrator to determine proper treatment of the distribution under your plan. Plans have two alternatives. First, the amount distributed after that event may be treated as eligible for rollover treatment. Alternatively, the distribution may be treated as ineligible for rollover even though another event, such as termination of employment, has occurred, which could entitle the recipient to a distribution without regard to hardship. Plans must be consistent in the treatment of all distributions. Plans also have alternatives with respect to allocation of basis. If a segment of a distribution that includes a hardship distribution is not includible in gross income (e.g., after-tax contributions), that piece may be allocated to either the portion ineligible for rollover or the portion eligible for rollover (or between the two portions) using any reasonable method. Again, plans must be consistent in the treatment of the distributions. Consult your plan administrator for additional information."
559,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Rollovers,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Remember, if you receive property (such as stock) as part of a rollover distribution, you cannot roll over cash in place of the property received unless the actual property is sold first. The proceeds from the bona fide sale may then be included in the rollover. Explanation Generally, an eligible rollover distribution means any distribution of all or any portion of an employee's balance in a qualified plan. Eligible rollover distributions do not include the following: ·    Required minimum distributions (e.g., distributions at the later of age 70½ or retirement from the employer maintaining the plan—except 5% owners do not have the retirement-delay option). Distributions that are part of a series of substantially equal payments received at least annually over the life or life expectancy of the employee (or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the employee and the employee's designated beneficiary), or over a period of at least 10 years; ·    Certain corrective distributions made because of the plan's violation of the Internal Revenue Code's limitations. For example, excess contributions returned to highly compensated employees, because the plan fails the 401(k) nondiscrimination (ADP) test for a year; ·    Loans treated as distributions because they violate the Internal Revenue Code's plan loan rules; ·    Certain dividends paid on employer securities; ·    Hardship distributions; ·    The cost of life insurance."
560,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Rollovers,,EY,TAXALERT,"A qualified plan must allow participants the option of a direct rollover to other qualified plans or an IRA. However, there is nothing in the law that requires your new employer to accept these amounts. If the new employer's plan will not accept these amounts, they could be transferred directly from your old employer's plan to an IRA."
561,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Rollovers,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Direct rollover. A direct rollover may be accomplished by the trustee making a wire transfer or mailing a check to the trustee of the recipient plan or IRA. The trustee may even provide you with a check and instruct you to deliver it to an eligible retirement plan or IRA. However, the check must be made payable only to the trustee or custodian of the eligible retirement plan, not to you. If you do a direct rollover, you can also roll over after-tax contributions to another qualified plan. Explanation You cannot be precluded from dividing an eligible rollover distribution into a portion you roll over and a portion you receive. However, your employer may not allow you to directly roll over any portion that is less than $500. Further, if there is basis in the qualified plan, the basis will be allocated pro rata between the direct rollover and the distribution to you."
562,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Rollovers,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Employers may, but need not, exclude eligible rollover distributions that are less than $200 from the direct rollover option if the administrator reasonably believes that total eligible rollover distributions from the plan during the year will be less than $200. In addition, employers are not required to withhold from distributions of less than $200 if the administrator reasonably believes that total eligible rollover distributions from the plan during the year will be less than $200. It should be noted, however, that amounts of $200 or less that constitute an eligible rollover distribution are still eligible for rollover by you within 60 days after receipt (see discussion later). An employer is not required to allow employees to have a direct rollover paid to more than one recipient plan. Therefore, if you wish to diversify an IRA investment, for example, you can subsequently roll over a distribution to another IRA or utilize an IRA trustee-to-trustee transfer. If an amount is subsequently transferred to a second IRA, it cannot be rolled over again for one year. However, there is no limit on direct IRA trustee-to-trustee transfers. The withholding requirement on eligible rollover distributions from a qualified plan can be avoided on a distribution received currently simply by having amounts transferred directly to an IRA and then immediately withdrawing them from the IRA."
563,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Rollovers,,EY,TAXALERT,"Plan administrators are required to give plan participants a written notice explaining the rollover rules, including the direct rollover option and related tax rules. You may consider whether to have your benefits paid in a direct rollover or paid directly to you for at least 30 days after you receive this notice, unless you waive this right. Explanation There is a second way amounts can be rolled over. If your funds are paid out to you rather than transferred in a direct rollover, you may still roll over some or all of your eligible rollover distribution to an eligible retirement plan. You must complete the rollover by the 60th day following the day on which you receive the distribution. In this case, the plan administrator making the distribution will withhold 20% of the taxable part of the distribution as income tax, and in order to roll over the full distribution, you will have to use other funds to make up the 20% withheld. If you do not make up the amount withheld, you will be taxed on the amount withheld and may also owe a 10% early distribution tax on such amount. See Tax on Early Distributions, later in this chapter. In this type of rollover, after-tax contributions can only be rolled into an IRA but not into a qualified plan."
564,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Rollovers,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"One of the most difficult decisions you have to make when you near retirement is what to do with the amounts held in your qualified pension or profit-sharing plan. There are usually four choices: 1. Retention in the plan. If you have more than $5,000 vested in the plan when you terminate employment, the plan must permit you to leave your accrued benefit or account balance in the qualified plan until you reach the later of age 62 or the plan's normal retirement age. (If you have $5,000 or less vested in the plan, the plan may require that you receive your account balance in a lump sum whether or not you consent. However, the $5,000 just affects whether you have a choice about getting a distribution. It neither limits the tax consequences, such as the 10% excise tax on premature distribution, nor affects your ability to roll over the money to a traditional or Roth IRA.) 2. Lump-sum distribution. While virtually all defined contribution plans offer lump-sum payments of benefits, many defined benefit pension plans do not offer lump-sum payments. Other defined benefit pension plans pay lump sums only if the value of benefits is de minimis ($5,000 or less). If you receive a lump-sum from either type of plan, the tax rules are the same. You must roll the distribution over to another qualified plan or to an IRA within 60 days, or the lump-sum distribution (other than the return of after-tax contributions) generally will be taxed to you as ordinary income; the after-tax balance will not be taxed. If you were born before 1936, you may be eligible to pay tax based on 10-year income averaging (discussed earlier). 3. Annuity. Defined benefit pension plans and money purchase plans must provide benefits in the form of a joint and survivor annuity. However, an employee, with spousal consent if the employee is married, may agree to receive the money as a lump sum (if the plan so provides). In a defined benefit pension plan, the normal form of payment is described as a single life annuity and is converted into a joint and survivor annuity. You will receive that amount (generally monthly) while you survive and your spouse usually will receive a reduced benefit monthly if he or she survives you. Larger plans pay the annuity from their assets; smaller plans will normally buy the annuity from an insurance company. In the case of a money purchase plan or other individual account plan, the participant has an account and the monthly annuity will be dependent on the annuity the account can purchase from the insurance company when you commence payments. Annuities directly from a plan typically pay more than annuities purchased in the individual insurance market. This is because of “adverse selection,” the idea that only the healthiest persons with the best genetic history will choose to use their lump sum to purchase an annuity. Income paid from an annuity is treated as ordinary regardless of whether the earnings actually resulted from qualified dividends and/or long-term capital gains. 4. Rollover to an IRA or other eligible retirement plan. There is no income tax required to be withheld on any portion of an eligible rollover distribution that is rolled over directly to a traditional IRA or other eligible retirement plan. The principal continues to earn income without tax until it is withdrawn. Withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income rates and are required to begin not later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70½, or following the calendar year of retirement in the case of an employer plan where the employee is not a 5% owner. Withdrawals from the plan or IRA are required to be made over the life of such employee or over the lives of such employee and a designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such employee or the joint life expectancy of such employee and a designated beneficiary). If the rollover is to a Roth IRA, discussed in the next paragraph, there are no required mandatory distributions while the participant is alive. Beginning in 2010, taxpayers at all income levels, including those who are married filing separately, are permitted to roll over (“convert”) a distribution from an employer qualified retirement plan and/or a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. Also, a 2010 tax law allows 401(k), 403(b), and governmental 457(b) plans, if they so choose, to permit participants to roll their pre-tax account balances into a designated Roth account within the same plan. The amount distributed is taxable income at the time of the distribution, except to the extent it includes nontaxable amounts (e.g., after-tax contributions). Contributions and earnings in an employer qualified retirement plan or traditional IRA grow tax-free. However, when funds are ultimately withdrawn, they are taxable to the participant. Contributions to a Roth IRA or designated Roth account have already been taxed, but grow tax-free and future withdrawals are not taxed, provided the funds are not withdrawn prematurely (until age 59½ and five years from the date of conversion; however, tax-free distributions may also be made under other circumstances such as disability). For more information, see the section on Roth IRAs in chapter 17, Individual retirement arrangements (IRAs)."
565,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Rollovers,,EY,TAXSAVER,"If you want to roll over the taxable portion of a distribution to a traditional IRA (so it is not currently taxed), and your basis to a Roth IRA so the earnings on the basis won't be taxed when eventually distributed, the safest way to do it is to have the plan distribute the full amount to you (withholding the necessary 20%). Within 60 days of the distribution, (in this order) roll over the taxable amount plus other funds equal to the amount withheld to a traditional IRA, and then on the next day (or after the first rollover and before 60 days from the date of the distribution), roll the remaining amount (all basis) to the Roth IRA. In this way, you will pay no tax on the distribution now, and the earnings on the basis will not be taxed on eventual distribution. If you are considering rolling over only your basis amount to a Roth IRA, you should consult with your tax advisor, as this is a complicated area. Example Example 1—401(k) Plan. You have $100,000 in the company's 401(k) plan and you will be retiring shortly at age 65. You may have the following options, depending on the plan's distribution and other provisions: Option 1—Leave the $100,000 in the Plan. Some plans require terminated participants to begin benefit payments at normal retirement age. However, many plans have the option of not requiring payments until April 1 of the year following the year the participant attains age 70½. Leaving amounts in the 401(k) plan as long as possible has some advantages, especially if you can direct the investments and are happy with the investment choices. A significant advantage is that you do not have to pay IRA administrative fees. It is also quite possible that the 401(k) plan allows investing in “wholesale” funds, which have lower fees than the “retail” funds you would have available for an IRA. Option 2—Take the $100,000 in the Form of a Lump-Sum Payment. Taking the lump-sum payment is only the first of your decisions. Remember, other than social security, this money may be the only money you have to live on for a long retirement. Consider other sources of income, such as savings, other plans, benefits from a prior employer, existing IRAs, and continued employment. All of these factors go into what decisions you make. Option 3—Roll the $100,000 into an IRA. Assuming you do not intend to spend the money immediately, another option is to directly roll it over to an IRA. (If you receive the distribution yourself and then roll it, the plan must withhold 20%—$20,000—for federal withholding, and to roll the entire distribution you will need to find that $20,000 from other resources.) Since you are older than 59½, you face no early distribution penalty, even if you take it all out the next day (if you've rolled it to a new Roth IRA, the rules are slightly different). Once you decide to directly roll it to an IRA, you will have to determine how to invest the money. Different IRAs may have different investment options and/or different fee structures. You should examine these before investing. Another alternative is to invest in an annuity through the IRA. An annuity pays a set monthly benefit for your life and the life of your spouse (if you elect). Individual annuities—even through an IRA—can be costly because only a select group of healthy people with good family health histories are inclined to purchase them. Option 4—If Available, Have the Plan Purchase an Annuity. The example involves a 401(k) plan. Generally, such plans are not required to provide an annuity. However, some do. In that case the plan administrator would take your account balance and purchase an annuity from an insurance company. Such an annuity may be expensive because of the unique nature of persons wanting an annuity. The annuity must be in the form of a joint and at least 50% survivor benefit unless you and, where appropriate, your spouse waive that form for another form such as a single life annuity or a lump sum. Example 2—Defined Benefit Plan. Assume you are a participant in a defined benefit plan and the plan would pay you a joint and 50% annuity of $12,000 per year while you are alive, and pay your spouse $6,000 a year after you die. Also assume the plan offers you the alternative of electing, with spousal consent, either an actuarially equivalent single life annuity of, say, $14,000 a year (not actuarially precise) or a one-time lump-sum payment of $100,000 (not actuarially precise). Option 1—Joint and 50% Annuity Starting Immediately. All defined benefit pension plans and money purchase plans must offer you a joint and 50% survivor annuity (they generally also have to offer at least a joint and 75% survivor annuity; other offerings are possible). Typically, a defined benefit plan of any size will pay you the annuity directly from the plan. Employers maintaining such plans fund the plan on an aggregate employee basis over time and your benefit is determined in the form of an annuity then converted to other forms on an actuarial basis. Option 2—Single Life Annuity. A joint and survivor annuity protects your spouse if you die before her/him. The greater the percentage, for example 75% vs. 50%, the greater the survivor benefit and generally the lower the joint benefit is (i.e., the benefit when you are alive). Whether a joint and survivor benefit is best and, if so, what size, depends on individual circumstances. Generally, if the other spouse has an annuity of his/her own of similar size, the joint and survivor benefit is unnecessary. Otherwise, it could be critical. There are downsides to an annuity. With an annuity, there is generally no money left if you die early and you cannot tap a larger monthly payment if you have needs for more money, for example because of medical costs. You also usually will not be able to leave any money for your heirs. Option 3—Lump Sum. An annuity form avoids you running out of money if you live a long time (although inflation will cut into the value of those monthly payments). However, in many instances, an annuity results in your survivors not receiving the value of your unpaid benefits if you die early. You could have a lump sum transferred directly to an IRA, where you can manage the investments and the flow of funds. However, in such situations, you have to worry about not overspending early. You can try to take the money out over your life expectancy, but what “life expectancy” means is that half the people die before it and half live past it. If you are one of those fortunate to live beyond life expectancy (or your spouse is) you could find yourself with no money left in the IRA. Example 3—Self-Employed or New Employer. If you will be self-employed during the year in which you retire, you can transfer your qualified pension plan account into a Keogh plan. The benefit of transferring your pension into a Keogh plan instead of an IRA is that, if you were born before January 2, 1936, you can be taxed using the 10-year averaging method (discussed earlier) if you withdraw the money from the Keogh in a lump-sum distribution. You cannot use the 10-year averaging method if you transfer your qualified pension plan account into an IRA. Many people find it easy to arrange to be self-employed in the year in which they retire. If the plan-to-plan transfer is done properly, you can preserve your pre-transfer service from the old plan for purposes of the 5-year minimum participation requirement. If you go to work for another employer immediately, you can directly transfer your balance to that employer's plan and preserve the 10-year averaging option. Remember, 10-year averaging is only available to those born before January 2, 1936. The choices are tricky and require analysis under various assumptions of interest rates, life expectancy, medical expenses, current needs, and tax rates. Professional help is necessary; you should consult your tax advisor. If you are a public safety officer (e.g., police, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians) who retires or becomes disabled, there is a special provision allowing you to withdraw up to $3,000 per year tax-free from your governmental retirement plan, if the distribution is used to purchase health, accident, or long-term insurance covering yourself, your spouse, or your dependents."
566,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Special Additional Taxes,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"To discourage the use of pension funds for purposes other than normal retirement, the law imposes additional taxes on early distributions of those funds and on failures to withdraw the funds timely. Ordinarily, you will not be subject to these taxes if you roll over all early distributions you receive, as explained earlier, and begin drawing out the funds at a normal retirement age, in reasonable amounts over your life expectancy. These special additional taxes are the taxes on: §  Early distributions, and §  Excess accumulation (not receiving minimum distributions). These taxes are discussed in the following sections. If you must pay either of these taxes, report them on Form 5329. However, you do not have to file Form 5329 if you owe only the tax on early distributions and all your Forms 1099-R correctly shows a “1” in box 7. Instead, enter 10% of the taxable part of the distribution on Form 1040, line 59 and write “No” under the heading “Other Taxes” to the left of line 59. Even if you do not owe any of these taxes, you may have to complete Form 5329 and attach it to your Form 1040. This applies if you meet an exception to the tax on early distributions but box 7 of your Form 1099-R does not indicate an exception."
567,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Special Additional Taxes,Tax on Early Distributions,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Most distributions (both periodic and nonperiodic) from qualified retirement plans and nonqualified annuity contracts made to you before you reach age 59½ are subject to an additional tax of 10%. This tax applies to the part of the distribution that you must include in gross income. For this purpose, a qualified retirement plan is: §  A qualified employee plan, §  A qualified employee annuity plan, §  A tax-sheltered annuity plan, or §  An eligible state or local government Section 457 deferred compensation plan (to the extent that any distribution is attributable to amounts the plan received in a direct transfer or rollover from one of the other plans listed here or an IRA). 5% rate on certain early distributions from deferred annuity contracts. If an early withdrawal from a deferred annuity is otherwise subject to the 10% additional tax, a 5% rate may apply instead. A 5% rate applies to distributions under a written election providing a specific schedule for the distribution of your interest in the contract if, as of March 1, 1986, you had begun receiving payments under the election. On line 4 of Form 5329, multiply the line 3 amount by 5% instead of 10%. Attach an explanation to your return.

569,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Special Additional Taxes,Tax on Early Distributions,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Exceptions to tax. Certain early distributions are excepted from the early distribution tax. If the payer knows that an exception applies to your early distribution, distribution code “2,” “3,” or “4” should be shown in box 7 of your Form 1099-R and you do not have to report the distribution on Form 5329. If an exception applies but distribution code “1” (early distribution, no known exception) is shown in box 7, you must file Form 5329.

The tax does not apply to distributions that are: §  Made as part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (made at least annually) for your life (or life expectancy) or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of you and your designated beneficiary (if from a qualified retirement plan, the payments must begin after your separation from service), §  Made because you are totally and permanently disabled. See Exceptions to Tax under Tax on Early Distributions in Publication 575, or §  Made on or after the death of the plan participant or contract holder."
570,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Special Additional Taxes,Tax on Early Distributions,EY,TAXPLANNER,"You should carefully consider whether substantially equal periodic distributions commencing before you attain age 59½ would be sufficient to satisfy your income needs. Although these distributions are not subject to the 10% early distribution tax, they will be subject to this tax if the amount of the distribution is modified (other than by reason of death, disability, or a change in method described later) either before you attain age 59½ or before the end of the calendar 5-year period beginning with the date of the first distribution and after you attain age 59½. In the year the distributions are modified, you will have to pay the 10% penalty tax on all of the distributions you have received to date, plus interest. For example, if you start receiving substantially equal periodic payments over your life expectancy in 2015 when you are age 58, and when you are age 62 in 2019 you take a larger distribution, you will have to pay the 10% penalty tax on all distributions received to date, plus interest. However, if you wait until the 5-year period ends, that is until 2020, there is no penalty if you modify the life expectancy distributions. Payments are considered to be substantially equal periodic payments if they are made in accordance with one of three calculations: (1) the required minimum distribution method, (2) the fixed amortization method, or (3) the fixed annuitization method. Because of the rule against modification of substantially equal periodic payments, described earlier, individuals who chose annuitization or amortization (which require a fixed amount to be withdrawn each year) would have to pay a retroactive penalty on all of the distributions made, if they wanted to reduce the amount of money they received in order to keep their account from being dissipated. The IRS allows individuals who started distributions using the fixed amortization method or the fixed annuitization method to change to the required minimum distribution method once without incurring that penalty."

(This exception to the 10% additional penalty tax is also available for similar distributions from an IRA. See Exemption from Additional 10% Tax for Distributions Received by National Guard or Reservists Called to Active Duty in chapter 17, Individual retirement arrangements (IRAs).) A refund or credit of the 10% early withdrawal tax previously paid on distributions that qualify for exemption from this penalty tax may be obtained.

The law also permits any portion of such distributions to be contributed back into an IRA anytime within the 2-year period following the end of the period of active duty. Although amounts contributed are not eligible for an IRA deduction, you may obtain a refund of the regular income tax you previously paid on the distribution by filing an amended return.

576,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Special Additional Taxes,Tax on Early Distributions,EY,TAXORGANIZER,"On Form 1099-R, distributions should be coded by the payer without regard to whether a rollover is made or anticipated (except for a direct rollover).

You may also be able to defer the minimum distributions from your IRA, if you are still working, by transferring your IRA balance to an employer plan sponsored by the employer for whom you are working as long as you're not a 5% or more owner of that employer. Consult your plan administrator or tax advisor for more information on the decision to delay minimum distributions."
581,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Special Additional Taxes,Tax on Excess Accumulation,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Because the penalty for failure to receive required minimum distributions is severe, you must take steps to ensure that you receive these amounts on a timely basis. The minimum distribution rules are particularly onerous for IRA owners who are required to determine their minimum distributions on their own. The IRS has issued final regulations and guidance that will make it easier for IRA owners to meet the minimum required distribution requirements. If a minimum distribution is required with respect to an IRA for a calendar year and the IRA owner is alive at the beginning of the year, the IRA trustee must provide a statement to the IRA owner by January 31 of the calendar year regarding the required minimum distribution in accordance with two alternatives. Under the first alternative, the IRA trustee must furnish the IRA owner with a statement of the amount of the required minimum distribution with respect to the IRA for the calendar year and the date by which such amount must be distributed. Under the second alternative, the IRA trustee must provide a statement to the IRA owner that: (1) informs the IRA owner that a minimum distribution with respect to the IRA is required for the calendar year and the date by which such amount must be distributed and (2) includes an offer to furnish the IRA owner, upon request, with a calculation of the amount of the required minimum distribution with respect to the IRA for that calendar year. If the IRA owner requests such a calculation, the IRA trustee must calculate the required minimum distribution for the IRA owner and report that amount to the IRA owner. IRA trustees may provide some IRA owners with statements that satisfy the first alternative and other IRA owners with statements that satisfy the second alternative."
582,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Special Additional Taxes,Tax on Excess Accumulation,EY,TAXPLANNER,"If you have made after-tax contributions to your employer's retirement plan (e.g., contributions other than pre-tax salary deferrals to a 401(k) plan or 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity), you may be able to satisfy the minimum distribution rules without being taxed for the first year (or possibly the first 2 years) the minimum distributions are required. This may be accomplished by: (1) electing to receive a lump-sum distribution from your retirement plan or IRA by April 1 of the year the minimum distributions are required to begin, (2) retaining the portion of the distribution that represents the tax-free return of your after-tax employee contributions, and (3) electing to roll over the remaining amount of the lump-sum distribution to another qualified retirement plan or IRA. Example Assume Dawn reaches age 70½ in 2016 and elects to retire in 2016. Also assume that Dawn has made a total of $40,000 in after-tax employee contributions to her employer's retirement plan over the years and has a balance of $100,000 in the plan as of the end of 2016. Dawn must receive the required minimum distribution (RMD) for 2016 by April 1, 2017. In addition, she must receive the RMD for 2017 by December 31, 2016. Assume the RMD amounts are $15,000 and $20,000 for 2016 and 2017, respectively. Dawn elects to receive a lump-sum distribution of her entire $100,000 account balance by April 1, 2017; retains $35,000 of this amount attributable to her after-tax employee contributions; and rolls over $65,000 to an IRA within 60 days of the distribution. As a result, she will not be taxed on the $35,000 she did not roll over since this is a nontaxable return of her after-tax contributions. More importantly, such nontaxable amounts may be used to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements. In this example, the $35,000 distributed to Dawn by April 1, 2017, equaled the sum of the $15,000 that was required to be distributed by April 1, 2017, and the $20,000 that was required to be distributed to her by December 31, 2017. After the rollover, Dawn would have basis of $5,000 (the balance of her after-tax contributions rolled into the IRA) in her new IRA."

584,Chapter 10,"Retirement plans, pensions, and annuities",Survivors and Beneficiaries,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Generally, a survivor or beneficiary reports pension or annuity income in the same way the plan participant would have. However, some special rules apply. See Publication 575 for more information. Survivors of employees. If you are entitled to receive a survivor annuity on the death of an employee who died, you can exclude part of each annuity payment as a tax-free recovery of the employee's investment in the contract. You must figure the taxable and tax-free parts of your annuity payments using the method that applies as if you were the employee. Survivors of retirees. If you receive benefits as a survivor under a joint and survivor annuity, include those benefits in income in the same way the retiree would have included them in income. If you receive a survivor annuity because of the death of a retiree who had reported the annuity under the Three-Year Rule and recovered all of the cost tax free, your survivor payments are fully taxable. If the retiree was reporting the annuity payments under the General Rule, you must apply the same exclusion percentage to your initial survivor annuity payment called for in the contract. The resulting tax-free amount will then remain fixed. Any increases in the survivor annuity are fully taxable. If the retiree was reporting the annuity payments under the Simplified Method, the part of each payment that is tax free is the same as the tax-free amount figured by the retiree at the annuity starting date. This amount remains fixed even if the annuity payments are increased or decreased. See Simplified Method, earlier. In any case, if the annuity starting date is after 1986, the total exclusion over the years cannot be more than the cost. Estate tax deduction. If your annuity was a joint and survivor annuity that was included in the decedent's estate, an estate tax may have been paid on it. You can deduct the part of the total estate tax that was based on the annuity. The deceased annuitant must have died after the annuity starting date. (For details, see Section 1.691(d)-1 of the regulations.) Deduct it in equal amounts over your remaining life expectancy. If the decedent died before the annuity starting date of a deferred annuity contract and you receive a death benefit under that contract, the amount you receive (either in a lump sum or as periodic payments) in excess of the decedent's cost is included in your gross income as income in respect of a decedent for which you may be able to claim an estate tax deduction. You can take the estate tax deduction as an itemized deduction on Schedule A, Form 1040. This deduction is not subject to the 2%-of-adjusted-gross-income limit on miscellaneous deductions. See Publication 559, Survivors, Executors, and Administrators, for more information on the estate tax deduction."

Alexander's beneficiary will receive $1,000 per year for the next 15 years. The estate tax figured with the annuity included is $4,500 more than when figured without the annuity. The recipient may claim an itemized deduction (not subject to the 2%-of-adjusted-gross-income limitation) each year of $300 ($1,000/$15,000 × $4,500). In this computation, the $15,000 represents the total dollars that will be received over the 15-year period."

But that hasn't been the case since 1984. Potentially, up to 85% of the benefits you receive may be subject to income tax, depending on your filing status and total income for the year. Figuring out whether the benefits you receive are taxable is not an easy task. It requires navigating through complicated rules and numerous computations. This chapter will aid in simplifying your task. Among other things, it includes worksheets to help you make the necessary calculations."
589,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"This chapter explains the federal income tax rules for social security benefits and equivalent tier 1 railroad retirement benefits. It explains the following topics. §  How to figure whether your benefits are taxable. §  How to use the social security benefits worksheet (with examples). §  How to report your taxable benefits. §  How to treat repayments that are more than the benefits you received during the year. Social security benefits include monthly retirement, survivor, and disability benefits. They do not include supplemental security income (SSI) payments, which are not taxable. Equivalent tier 1 railroad retirement benefits are the part of tier 1 benefits that a railroad employee or beneficiary would have been entitled to receive under the social security system. They are commonly called the social security equivalent benefit (SSEB) portion of tier 1 benefits. If you received these benefits during 2016, you should have received a Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement, or Form RRB-1099, Payments by the Railroad Retirement Board. These forms show the amounts received and repaid, and taxes withheld for the year. You may receive more than one of these forms for the same year. You should add the amounts shown on all the Forms SSA-1099 and Forms RRB-1099 you receive for the year to determine the total amounts received and repaid, and taxes withheld for that year. See the Appendix at the end of Publication 915 for more information. Note. When the term “benefits” is used in this chapter, it applies to both social security benefits and the SSEB portion of tier 1 railroad retirement benefits. my Social Security account. Social Security beneficiaries may quickly and easily obtain various information from the SSA's website with a my Social Security account to: §  Keep track of your earnings and verify them every year, §  Get an estimate of your future benefits if you are still working, §  Get a letter with proof of your benefits if you currently receive them, §  Change your address, §  Start or change your direct deposit, §  Get a replacement Medicare card, and §  Get a replacement SSA-1099 for the tax season. For more information and to set up an account, go to www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount. What is not covered in this chapter. This chapter does not cover the tax rules for the following railroad retirement benefits. §  Non-social security equivalent benefit (NSSEB) portion of tier 1 benefits. §  Tier 2 benefits. §  Vested dual benefits. §  Supplemental annuity benefits. For information on these benefits, see Publication 575, Pension and Annuity Income. This chapter does not cover the tax rules for social security benefits reported on Form SSA-1042S, Social Security Benefit Statement, or Form RRB-1042S, Statement for Nonresident Alien Recipients of: Payments by the Railroad Retirement Board. For information about these benefits, see Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, and Publication 915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits. This chapter also does not cover the tax rules for foreign social security benefits. These benefits are taxable as annuities, unless they are exempt from U.S. tax or treated as a U.S. social security benefit under a tax treaty."
590,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,,,EY,Tax Breaks and Deductions You Can Use Checklist,"Deduction for repaid disability benefits. If you received disability payments from your employer or an insurance company in an earlier year that you included in your taxable income and have since repaid these benefits due to the receipt of a lump-sum payment from the Social Security Administration (SSA) or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), you can take an itemized deduction for the part of those repaid benefits that had been previously included in your income. If you repay more than $3,000, you may be able to claim a tax credit instead. For more information, see Repayment of benefits received in an earlier year, later. Reducing your taxable social security income. Social security and railroad retirement benefits are partially taxable if your total income (defined later in this chapter) is more than $32,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly and $25,000 for single filers. If you expect your total income will be in excess of these amounts, consider the income reduction strategies discussed later in this chapter to reduce your income and the taxability of your social security benefits."

598,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,Are Any of Your Benefits Taxable?,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Social security and railroad retirement benefits are partially taxable if your total income (defined later in this paragraph) is more than $32,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly and $25,000 for single filers.

599,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,Are Any of Your Benefits Taxable?,,EY,TAXSAVER,"If you expect your total income (defined in the preceding explanation) to exceed the base amount ($32,000 if you are filing a joint return, $25,000 if you are filing single), you may wish to consider the following strategies: ·    Defer the recognition of income by investing in U.S. savings bonds. Generally, the increase in value of the bonds issued at a discount (Series E and EE) is not taxable until you surrender the bonds. Additionally, if you hold the bonds until death, your heirs will recognize the income (assuming you did not elect to include in income the annual increase in the value of the bond). ·    Purchase a certificate of deposit that matures in 2017 or later. None of the interest earned will be subject to tax in 2016, as long as any interest received this year would be penalized by the issuer of the CD upon withdrawal by the purchaser. ·    Offset capital gains in 2016 by selling property in which you have unrealized capital losses. ·    Stagger the recognition of income so that you have alternating years of higher income. Depending on your income level, you could structure income so that your social security benefits are taxed every other year. For example, when considering sources of cash flow, you could surrender U.S. savings bonds and sell appreciated property in alternate years. You could also schedule the maturity dates of U.S. Treasury notes and bills to ensure that your income is under the base amount in certain years. ·    If you have earned income, consider contributing to your company's 401(k) plan, your not-for-profit 403(b) plan, or a deductible Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) account (see chapter 17, Individual retirement arrangements (IRAs), to determine if you qualify) to decrease your adjusted gross income and also reduce the taxable portion of your social security benefits."
600,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,Are Any of Your Benefits Taxable?,,EY,Tip,"If the only income you received during 2016 was your social security or the SSEB portion of tier 1 railroad retirement benefits, your benefits generally are not taxable and you probably do not have to file a return. If you have income in addition to your benefits, you may have to file a return even if none of your benefits are taxable."
601,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,Are Any of Your Benefits Taxable?,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Tax-exempt income is added to your adjusted gross income for purposes of calculating how much, if any, of your social security benefits will be subject to tax.

Benefits are included in the taxable income (to the extent they are taxable) of the person who has the legal right to receive the benefits. For example, if you and your child receive benefits, but the check for your child is made out in your name, you must use only your part of the benefits to see whether any benefits are taxable to you. One-half of the part that belongs to your child must be added to your child's other income to see whether any of those benefits are taxable to your child. Repayment of benefits. Any repayment of benefits you made during 2016 must be subtracted from the gross benefits you received in 2016. It does not matter whether the repayment was for a benefit you received in 2016 or in an earlier year. If you repaid more than the gross benefits you received in 2016, see Repayments More Than Gross Benefits, later. Your gross benefits are shown in box 3 of Form SSA-1099 or RRB-1099. Your repayments are shown in box  4. The amount in box  5 shows your net benefits for 2016 (box 3 minus box 4). Use the amount in box 5 to figure whether any of your benefits are taxable."

Consult your tax advisor or state income tax authority for details.
612,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,How To Report Your Benefits,How Much Is Taxable?,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Which worksheet to use. A worksheet you can use to figure your taxable benefits is in the instructions for your Form 1040 or Form 1040A. You can use either that worksheet or Worksheet 1 in Publication 915, unless any of the following situations applies to you. 1.   You contributed to a traditional individual retirement arrangement (IRA) and you or your spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work. In this situation, you must use the special worksheets in Appendix B of Publication 590-A to figure both your IRA deduction and your taxable benefits. 2.   Situation (1) does not apply and you take an exclusion for interest from qualified U.S. savings bonds (Form 8815), for adoption benefits (Form 8839), for foreign earned income or housing (Form 2555 or Form 2555-EZ), or for income earned in American Samoa (Form 4563) or Puerto Rico by bona fide residents. In this situation, you must use Worksheet 1 in Publication 915 to figure your taxable benefits. 3.   You received a lump-sum payment for an earlier year. In this situation, also complete Worksheet 2 or 3 and Worksheet 4 in Publication 915. See Lump-sum election next."
613,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,How To Report Your Benefits,How Much Is Taxable?,EY,Tip,This type of lump-sum benefit payment should not be confused with the lump-sum death benefit that both the SSA and RRB pay to many of their beneficiaries. No part of the lump-sum death benefit is subject to tax.
614,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,How To Report Your Benefits,How Much Is Taxable?,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Lump-sum election. You must include the taxable part of a lump-sum (retroactive) payment of benefits received in 2016 in your 2016 income, even if the payment includes benefits for an earlier year. Generally, you use your 2016 income to figure the taxable part of the total benefits received in 2016. However, you may be able to figure the taxable part of a lump-sum payment for an earlier year separately, using your income for the earlier year. You can elect this method if it lowers your taxable benefits."
615,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,How To Report Your Benefits,How Much Is Taxable?,EY,Caution,"Because the earlier year's taxable benefits are included in your 2016 income, no adjustment is made to the earlier year's return. Do not file an amended return for the earlier year."
616,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,How To Report Your Benefits,How Much Is Taxable?,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Making the election. If you received a lump-sum benefit payment in 2016 that includes benefits for one or more earlier years, follow the instructions in Publication 915 under Lump-Sum Election to see whether making the election will lower your taxable benefits. That discussion also explains how to make the election."
617,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,How To Report Your Benefits,How Much Is Taxable?,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Estimated tax. Generally, tax is not withheld on social security benefits. This means that you may have to pay estimated tax during the year if these benefits are taxable and you do not have enough taxes withheld from other income. However, you may request to have federal income tax withheld from your benefits at 7%, 10%, 15%, or 25%, but no other percentage or amount is allowed. This request is made by completing Form W-4V, Voluntary Withholding Request, and giving it to the agency making the payments. See chapter 4, Tax withholding and estimated tax, for more information on estimated tax."
618,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,Examples,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"The following are a few examples you can use as a guide to figure the taxable part of your benefits. Example 1. George White is single and files Form 1040 for 2016. He received the following income in 2016: Fully taxable pension …………………………………….. $18,600 Wages from part-time job …………………………………    9,400 Taxable interest income ………………………………….        990 Total ………………………………………………………    $28,990 George also received social security benefits during 2016. The Form SSA-1099 he received in January 2017 shows $5,980 in box 5. To figure his taxable benefits, George completes the worksheet shown here. The amount on line 19 of George's worksheet shows that $2,990 of his social security benefits is taxable. On line 20a of his Form 1040, George enters his net benefits of $5,980. On line 20b, he enters his taxable benefits of $2,990. Filled-in Worksheet 1 Figuring Your Taxable Benefits [c11f003.tif] Example 2. Ray and Alice Hopkins file a joint return on Form 1040A for 2016. Ray is retired and received a fully taxable pension of $15,500. He also received social security benefits, and his Form SSA-1099 for 2016 shows net benefits of $5,600 in box 5. Alice worked during the year and had wages of $14,000. She made a deductible payment to her IRA account of $1,000 and is not covered by a retirement plan at work. Ray and Alice have two savings accounts with a total of $250 in taxable interest income. They complete Worksheet 1, entering $29,750 ($15,500 + $14,000 + $250) on line 3. They find none of Ray's social security benefits are taxable. On Form 1040A, they enter $5,600 on line 14a and -0- on line 14b. Filled-in Worksheet 1 Figuring Your Taxable Benefits [c11f004.tif] Example 3. Joe and Betty Johnson file a joint return on Form 1040 for 2016. Joe is a retired railroad worker and in 2016 received the social security equivalent benefit (SSEB) portion of tier 1 railroad retirement benefits. Joe's Form RRB-1099 shows $10,000 in box  5. Betty is a retired government worker and receives a fully taxable pension of $38,000. They had $2,300 in taxable interest income plus interest of $200 on a qualified U.S. savings bond. The savings bond interest qualified for the exclusion. They figure their taxable benefits by completing Worksheet 1. Because they have qualified U.S. savings bond interest, they follow the note at the beginning of the worksheet and use the amount from line 2 of their Schedule B (Form 1040A or 1040) on line 3 of the worksheet instead of the amount from line 8a of their Form 1040. On line 3 of the worksheet, they enter $40,500 ($38,000 + $2,500). Filled-in Worksheet 1 Figuring Your Taxable Benefits [c11f005.tif] More than 50% of Joe's net benefits are taxable because the income on line 8 of the worksheet ($45,500) is more than $44,000. Joe and Betty enter $10,000 on Form 1040, line 20a, and $6,275 on Form 1040, line 20b."
619,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,Deductions Related To Your Benefits,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"You may be entitled to deduct certain amounts related to the benefits you receive. Disability payments. You may have received disability payments from your employer or an insurance company that you included as income on your tax return in an earlier year. If you received a lump-sum payment from SSA or RRB, and you had to repay the employer or insurance company for the disability payments, you can take an itemized deduction for the part of the payments you included in gross income in the earlier year. If the amount you repay is more than $3,000, you may be able to claim a tax credit instead. Claim the deduction or credit in the same way explained under Repayments More Than Gross Benefits, later. Legal expenses. You can usually deduct legal expenses that you pay or incur to produce or collect taxable income or in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax. Legal expenses for collecting the taxable part of your benefits are deductible as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 23."
620,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,Repayments More Than Gross Benefits,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"In some situations, your Form SSA-1099 or Form RRB-1099 will show that the total benefits you repaid (box  4) are more than the gross benefits (box 3) you received. If this occurred, your net benefits in box  5 will be a negative figure (a figure in parentheses) and none of your benefits will be taxable. Do not use a worksheet in this case. If you receive more than one form, a negative figure in box 5 of one form is used to offset a positive figure in box  5 of another form for that same year. If you have any questions about this negative figure, contact your local SSA office or your local RRB field office. Joint return. If you and your spouse file a joint return, and your Form SSA-1099 or RRB-1099 has a negative figure in box 5, but your spouse's does not, subtract the amount in box 5 of your form from the amount in box 5 of your spouse's form. You do this to get your net benefits when figuring if your combined benefits are taxable. Example. John and Mary file a joint return for 2016. John received Form SSA-1099 showing $3,000 in box 5. Mary also received Form SSA-1099 and the amount in box 5 was ($500). John and Mary will use $2,500 ($3,000 minus $500) as the amount of their net benefits when figuring if any of their combined benefits are taxable."
621,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,Repayments More Than Gross Benefits,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Social security benefits are determined on a cash basis, just like most other income of individuals. Accordingly, repayments of prior-year amounts reduce current-year benefits."
622,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,Repayments More Than Gross Benefits,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Repayment of benefits received in an earlier year. If the total amount shown in box  5 of all of your Forms SSA-1099 and RRB-1099 is a negative figure, you can take an itemized deduction for the part of this negative figure that represents benefits you included in gross income in an earlier year. Deduction $3,000 or less. If this deduction is $3,000 or less, it is subject to the 2%-of-adjusted-gross-income limit that applies to certain miscellaneous itemized deductions. Claim it on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 23. Deduction more than $3,000. If this deduction is more than $3,000, you should figure your tax two ways: 1.   Figure your tax for 2016 with the itemized deduction included on Schedule A, line 28. 2.   Figure your tax for 2016 in the following steps. a.     Figure the tax without the itemized deduction included on Schedule A, line 28. b.    For each year after 1983 for which part of the negative figure represents a repayment of benefits, refigure your taxable benefits as if your total benefits for the year were reduced by that part of the negative figure. Then refigure the tax for that year. c.     Subtract the total of the refigured tax amounts in (b) from the total of your actual tax amounts. d.    Subtract the result in (c) from the result in (a). Compare the tax figured in methods (1) and (2). Your tax for 2016 is the smaller of the two amounts. If method (1) results in less tax, take the itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 28. If method (2) results in less tax, claim a credit for the amount from step 2(c) above on Form 1040, line 71. Check box d and enter “I.R.C. 1341” in the space next to that box. If both methods produce the same tax, deduct the repayment on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 28."
623,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,Repayments More Than Gross Benefits,,EY,EXPLANATION,This confusing computation allows you to reduce your current tax by the greater of two amounts: (1) the amount of tax you would save by taking the deduction this year; or (2) the net increase in tax in the prior year(s) as a result of including the amount in income.
624,Chapter 11,Social security and equivalent railroad retirement benefits,Repayments More Than Gross Benefits,,EY,TAXSAVER,"The Social Security Administration (SSA) can reduce your monthly benefits if you have earned income in excess of the threshold amounts and are under full retirement age. The retirement earnings test has been eliminated for individuals attaining full retirement. However, a test remains in effect for individuals ages 62 through full retirement age. For individuals between the ages of 62 and the year their full retirement age is reached, each $2 of income earned in 2016 over $15,720 will reduce their social security benefits by $1. For the year in which an individual reaches full retirement age, each $3 of income earned in 2016 over $41,880 will reduce social security benefits by $1. The $41,880 threshold applies only for the year in which you reach full retirement age, up to the actual month you attain full retirement age. There is no limit on earnings beginning the month you attain full retirement age. Other exceptions apply during the initial year you receive social security retirement benefits.

631,Chapter 12,Other income,,,EY,Introduction,"Your salary, interest you earn, dividends received, a gain from the sale of securities—all of these, of course, are taxable income. Unfortunately, so are a lot of other things: a debt forgiven by a friend, jury pay, a free trip you receive from a travel agency for organizing a group of tourists, lottery and gambling winnings, and royalties you earn on a book. The general rule is that anything that enriches you should be included in your gross income, unless it is specifically excluded by the tax law. Indeed, some things are excluded from taxation. Generally, you don't have to pay income tax on life insurance proceeds that you receive because of the death of the insured. Most gifts and inheritances are excluded from income tax. The value of the vegetables you grow in your garden and eat yourself is not taxable. This chapter tells you what kind of income is not taxable, and how you can tell the difference. This chapter includes a discussion on passive activity losses. Passive investments include all rental activities, investments in limited partnerships, and those other businesses in which the taxpayer is not involved in the operations on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis."
632,Chapter 12,Other income,,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"You must include on your return all items of income you receive in the form of money, property, and services unless the tax law states that you do not include them. Some items, however, are only partly excluded from income. This chapter discusses many kinds of income and explains whether they are taxable or nontaxable. §  Income that is taxable must be reported on your tax return and is subject to tax. §  Income that is nontaxable may have to be shown on your tax return but is not taxable. This chapter begins with discussions of the following income items. §  Bartering. §  Canceled debts. §  Sales parties at which you are the host or hostess. §  Life insurance proceeds. §  Partnership income. §  S corporation income. §  Recoveries (including state income tax refunds). §  Rents from personal property. §  Repayments. §  Royalties. §  Unemployment benefits. §  Welfare and other public assistance benefits. These discussions are followed by brief discussions of other income items."
633,Chapter 12,Other income,,,EY,Tax Breaks and Deductions You Can Use Checklist,"Canceled debts. Generally, you must include in income the portion of any debt that is canceled or forgiven. However, amounts forgiven as a gift or bequest are exempt from your income. For more information, see Canceled Debts, later. Disaster relief grants. You can exclude from your gross income a grant you receive under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act if the grant payments are received to help you meet certain serious needs, such as housing, transportation, and medical expenses. For more information, see Welfare and Other Public Assistance Benefits: Disaster Relief Grants, later. Disaster relief payments. Qualified disaster relief payments you receive are not subject to income tax, social security, or Medicare taxes. Qualified payments include amounts paid as a result of a qualified disaster to reimburse or pay reasonable and necessary personal, family, living, or funeral expenses that result from a qualified disaster; to repair or rehabilitate your personal residence; or to repair or replace damaged personal contents. For more information, see Welfare and Other Public Assistance Benefits: Disaster Relief Payments, later. Disaster mitigation payments. You can exclude from your gross income a qualified disaster mitigation payment grant that you receive from a state or local government if you use the grant to reduce the severity of potential damage from a future natural disaster. For more information, see Welfare and Other Public Assistance Benefits: Disaster Mitigation Payments, later. Unlawful discrimination claims. If you receive damages from a settlement or judgment in a lawsuit for unlawful discrimination that was settled or decided after October 22, 2004, you may be able to deduct attorney fees and court costs paid after that date. Your deduction is limited to the amount of the settlement or judgment you included in income. For more information, see Court awards and damages and Deduction for costs involved in unlawful discrimination suits, later, and Publication 525. Life insurance proceeds. Life insurance proceeds paid to you because of the death of the insured person are not taxable unless the policy was turned over to you for a price.

636,Chapter 12,Other income,Bartering,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Bartering is an exchange of property or services. You must include in your income, at the time received, the fair market value of property or services you receive in bartering. If you exchange services with another person and you both have agreed ahead of time on the value of the services, that value will be accepted as fair market value unless the value can be shown to be otherwise. Generally, you report this income on Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business, or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040), Net Profit From Business. However, if the barter involves an exchange of something other than services, such as in Example 3 below, you may have to use another form or schedule instead."
637,Chapter 12,Other income,Bartering,,EY,EXPLANATION,"The IRS explanation is correct in stating that if you exchange your property and/or services for the property and/or services of another, you have taxable income. However, when you exchange property for property, you generally recognize income only to the extent that the fair market value of the property you receive exceeds your adjusted basis in the property you give up (note that an exception to this general rule is for like-kind exchanges). The proper way of determining gain on exchanges of property and your basis in the property you receive are discussed in chapter 13, Basis of property, and chapter 14, Sale of property."
638,Chapter 12,Other income,Bartering,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Example 1. You are a self-employed attorney who performs legal services for a client, a small corporation. The corporation gives you shares of its stock as payment for your services. You must include the fair market value of the shares in your income on Schedule C (Form 1040) or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040) in the year you receive them. Example 2. You are self-employed and a member of a barter club. The club uses “credit units” as a means of exchange. It adds credit units to your account for goods or services you provide to members, which you can use to purchase goods or services offered by other members of the barter club. The club subtracts credit units from your account when you receive goods or services from other members. You must include in your income the value of the credit units that are added to your account, even though you may not actually receive goods or services from other members until a later tax year. Example 3. You own a small apartment building. In return for 6 months rent-free use of an apartment, an artist gives you a work of art she created. You must report as rental income on Schedule E (Form 1040), Supplemental Income and Loss, the fair market value of the artwork, and the artist must report as income on Schedule C (Form 1040) or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040) the fair rental value of the apartment. Form 1099-B from barter exchange. If you exchanged property or services through a barter exchange, Form 1099-B, Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions, or a similar statement from the barter exchange should be sent to you by February 15, 2017. It should show the value of cash, property, services, credits, or scrip you received from exchanges during 2016. The IRS also will receive a copy of Form 1099-B."
639,Chapter 12,Other income,Canceled Debts,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"In most cases, if a debt you owe is canceled or forgiven, other than as a gift or bequest, you must include the canceled amount in your income. You have no income from the canceled debt if it is intended as a gift to you. A debt includes any indebtedness for which you are liable or which attaches to property you hold. If the debt is a nonbusiness debt, report the canceled amount on Form 1040, line 21. If it is a business debt, report the amount on Schedule C (Form 1040) or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040) (or on Schedule F (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Farming, if the debt is farm debt and you are a farmer)."
640,Chapter 12,Other income,Canceled Debts,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Family members often make interest-free or below-market interest rate loans to one another. The IRS may re-characterize these loans as arm's-length transactions and impute interest income to the lender and interest expense to the borrower, which are then reported on their respective tax returns, although the interest expense may not be deductible if it is considered nondeductible personal interest (discussed in chapter 24, Interest expense). See chapter 7, Interest income, for further discussion of below-market loans. You should consult your tax advisor about how to report any below-market loan transactions."
641,Chapter 12,Other income,Canceled Debts,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Form 1099-C. If a federal government agency, financial institution, or credit union cancels or forgives a debt you owe of $600 or more, you will receive a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt. The amount of the canceled debt is shown in box  2. Interest included in canceled debt. If any interest is forgiven and included in the amount of canceled debt in box  2, the amount of interest also will be shown in box 3. Whether or not you must include the interest portion of the canceled debt in your income depends on whether the interest would be deductible when you paid it. See Deductible debt under Exceptions, later. If the interest would not be deductible (such as interest on a personal loan), include in your income the amount from Form 1099-C, box 2. If the interest would be deductible (such as on a business loan), include in your income the net amount of the canceled debt (the amount shown in box 2 less the interest amount shown in box  3). Discounted mortgage loan. If your financial institution offers a discount for the early payment of your mortgage loan, the amount of the discount is canceled debt. You must include the canceled amount in your income."
642,Chapter 12,Other income,Canceled Debts,,EY,TAXSAVER,"Proceed cautiously if the financial institution that holds your mortgage offers you a substantial discount on your loan balance in exchange for a prepayment on it. Although this might at first appear very attractive, remember that you will have to pay ordinary income tax on the amount of the discount offered, which may considerably reduce any advantage to you. Your money might be put to better use in investments with a high after-tax yield or in paying off expensive consumer credit debt."
643,Chapter 12,Other income,Canceled Debts,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Mortgage relief upon sale or other disposition. If you are personally liable for a mortgage (recourse debt), and you are relieved of the mortgage when you dispose of the property, you may realize gain or loss up to the fair market value of the property. Also, to the extent the mortgage discharge exceeds the fair market value of the property, it is income from discharge of indebtedness unless it qualifies for exclusion under Excluded debt, later. Report any income from discharge of indebtedness on nonbusiness debt that does not qualify for exclusion as other income on Form 1040, line 21. If you are not personally liable for a mortgage (nonrecourse debt), and you are relieved of the mortgage when you dispose of the property (such as through foreclosure), that relief is included in the amount you realize. You may have a taxable gain if the amount you realize exceeds your adjusted basis in the property. Report any gain on nonbusiness property as a capital gain. See Publication 4681 for more information."
644,Chapter 12,Other income,Canceled Debts,,EY,TAXSAVER,"Exclusion from Gross Income of Certain Discharged Mortgage Debt. You can exclude from gross income, income realized from the discharge after 2006 and before 2017 of up to $2 million ($1 million if married filing separately) of qualified principal residence indebtedness. However, your basis in your principal residence would be reduced by the amount excluded from income. (The exclusion is also available for taxpayers whose qualified principal residence indebtedness was discharged after January 1, 2017, if the discharge was pursuant to a binding written agreement entered into before 2017.) For more information, see Discharges of qualified principal residence indebtedness in chapter 15, Selling your home. This exclusion is scheduled to expire at the end of 2016 unless Congress acts to extend it. For updated information on this and any other tax law changes that occur after this book was published, see our website, ey.com/EYTaxGuide."
645,Chapter 12,Other income,Canceled Debts,,EY,TAXSAVER,"If you have gross income from the discharge of mortgage indebtedness and you are insolvent, you may be able to exclude the amount of the canceled debt in your gross income. IRS Publication 908, Bankruptcy Tax Guide, explains that a debtor is insolvent when, and to the extent, the debtor's liabilities exceed the fair market value of his or her assets. Whether or not the debtor is insolvent is tested immediately before the cancellation of the debtor's debt. So if the debtor is insolvent, the debtor can exclude from gross income the canceled debt, but only up the amount by which the debtor is insolvent. If your mortgage indebtedness is discharged, it is key to establish whether and to what extent you are insolvent. It is important to keep appropriate records establishing the amount of the insolvency. The downside of claiming insolvency and choosing not to include the amount of the canceled debt in your income is that certain tax attributes are reduced by the amount the cancelled debt is not included in gross income. IRS Form 982, Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness, will need to be completed. Tax attributes that can be reduced include net operating losses, minimum tax credit, capital losses, basis in the debtor's property, and passive activity losses and carryovers."
646,Chapter 12,Other income,Canceled Debts,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Stockholder debt. If you are a stockholder in a corporation and the corporation cancels or forgives your debt to it, the canceled debt is a constructive distribution that is generally dividend income to you. For more information, see Publication 542, Corporations. If you are a stockholder in a corporation and you cancel a debt owed to you by the corporation, you generally do not realize income. This is because the canceled debt is considered as a contribution to the capital of the corporation equal to the amount of debt principal that you canceled. Repayment of canceled debt. If you included a canceled amount in your income and later pay the debt, you may be able to file a claim for refund for the year the amount was included in income.

The statute of limitations generally does not end until 3 years after the due date of your original return."
647,Chapter 12,Other income,Canceled Debts,Exceptions,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"There are several exceptions to the inclusion of canceled debt in income. These are explained next. Student loans. Certain student loans contain a provision that all or part of the debt incurred to attend the qualified educational institution will be canceled if you work for a certain period of time in certain professions for any of a broad class of employers. You do not have income if your student loan is canceled after you agreed to this provision and then performed the services required. To qualify, the loan must have been made by: 1.    The federal government, a state or local government, or an instrumentality, agency, or subdivision thereof, 2.    A tax-exempt public benefit corporation that has assumed control of a state, county, or municipal hospital, and whose employees are considered public employees under state law, or 3.    An educational institution: §  Under an agreement with an entity described in (1) or (2) that provided the funds to the institution to make the loan, or §  As part of a program of the institution designed to encourage its students to serve in occupations with unmet needs or in areas with unmet needs and under which the services provided by the students (or former students) are for or under the direction of a governmental unit or a tax-exempt organization described in Section 501(c)(3). A loan to refinance a qualified student loan also will qualify if it was made by an educational institution or a qualified tax-exempt organization under its program designed as described in (3) (b) above. Education loan repayment assistance. Education loan repayments made to you by the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program (NHSC Loan Repayment Program), a state education loan repayment program eligible for funds under the Public Health Service Act, or any other state loan repayment or loan forgiveness program that is intended to provide for the increased availability of health services in underserved or health professional shortage areas are not taxable. Deductible debt. You do not have income from the cancellation of a debt if your payment of the debt would be deductible. This exception applies only if you use the cash method of accounting. For more information, see chapter 5 of Publication 334, Tax Guide for Small Business. Price reduced after purchase. In most cases, if the seller reduces the amount of debt you owe for property you purchased, you do not have income from the reduction. The reduction of the debt is treated as a purchase price adjustment and reduces your basis in the property. Excluded debt. Do not include a canceled debt in your gross income in the following situations. §  The debt is canceled in a bankruptcy case under title 11 of the U.S. Code. See Publication 908, Bankruptcy Tax Guide. §  The debt is canceled when you are insolvent. However, you cannot exclude any amount of canceled debt that is more than the amount by which you are insolvent. See Publication 908. §  The debt is qualified farm debt and is canceled by a qualified person. See chapter 3 of Publication 225, Farmer's Tax Guide. §  The debt is qualified real property business debt. See chapter 5 of Publication 334. §  The cancellation is intended as a gift."

660,Chapter 12,Other income,Life Insurance Proceeds,Endowment Contract Proceeds,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"An endowment contract is a policy under which you are paid a specified amount of money on a certain date unless you die before that date, in which case, the money is paid to your designated beneficiary. Endowment proceeds paid in a lump sum to you at maturity are taxable only if the proceeds are more than the cost of the policy. To determine your cost, subtract any amount that you previously received under the contract and excluded from your income from the total premiums (or other consideration) paid for the contract.

661,Chapter 12,Other income,Life Insurance Proceeds,Endowment Contract Proceeds,EY,TAXSAVER,"There are a number of ways in which insurance proceeds may be paid. The choice may have been made by the deceased, or the choice may belong to the recipient of the proceeds. In either case, proper planning may save tax dollars and increase wealth. Generally, the insured should not decide how the insurance benefits are to be paid, unless he or she is worried that the beneficiary might squander the money. Absent that, determining the method of payment should be left to the beneficiary, who, after the death of the insured, is in the best position to consider potential investments, as well as tax benefits."
662,Chapter 12,Other income,Life Insurance Proceeds,Endowment Contract Proceeds,EY,EXPLANATION,"Endowment contracts, much like whole life insurance contracts, require you, as the owner, to pay annual premiums in return for a certain sum of cash that is paid when you reach a specified age or upon death. Unless you choose to receive the endowment proceeds in installments, the excess of the proceeds over the cost of the policy is taxable in the year of maturity, even if the proceeds are not received until a later year. The excess of the proceeds over the cost of the policy is taxed as ordinary income, not as capital gain. The cost of the endowment contract is the total amount of the premiums you paid for it, not its cash value at the time of maturity or when you surrender it. However, if you agree to take the proceeds as an annuity within 60 days after the lump-sum payment becomes available and before you receive any cash, you are not considered to have received the lump sum for tax purposes. The lump sum is taxed as an annuity; that is, you are taxed on the amounts as you receive them each year. For certain contracts entered into or materially changed after June 21, 1988, you may be required to treat distributions first as income and then as recovery of investment. Distributions are defined for this purpose to include a loan. In certain circumstances, an additional 10% tax will be imposed on the amount that is includible in gross income. Consult your tax advisor to determine if you are subject to this provision."
663,Chapter 12,Other income,Life Insurance Proceeds,Accelerated Death Benefits,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Certain amounts paid as accelerated death benefits under a life insurance contract or viatical settlement before the insured's death are excluded from income if the insured is terminally or chronically ill. Viatical settlement. This is the sale or assignment of any part of the death benefit under a life insurance contract to a viatical settlement provider. A viatical settlement provider is a person who regularly engages in the business of buying or taking assignment of life insurance contracts on the lives of insured individuals who are terminally or chronically ill and who meets the requirements of Section 101(g)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. Exclusion for terminal illness. Accelerated death benefits are fully excludable if the insured is a terminally ill individual. This is a person who has been certified by a physician as having an illness or physical condition that can reasonably be expected to result in death within 24 months from the date of the certification. Exclusion for chronic illness. If the insured is a chronically ill individual who is not terminally ill, accelerated death benefits paid on the basis of costs incurred for qualified long-term care services are fully excludable. Accelerated death benefits paid on a per diem or other periodic basis are excludable up to a limit. This limit applies to the total of the accelerated death benefits and any periodic payments received from long-term care insurance contracts. For information on the limit and the definitions of chronically ill individual, qualified long-term care services, and long-term care insurance contracts, see Long-Term Care Insurance Contracts under Sickness and Injury Benefits in Publication 525. Exception. The exclusion does not apply to any amount paid to a person (other than the insured) who has an insurable interest in the life of the insured because the insured: §  Is a director, officer, or employee of the person, or §  Has a financial interest in the person's business. Form 8853. To claim an exclusion for accelerated death benefits made on a per diem or other periodic basis, you must file Form 8853, Archer MSAs and Long-Term Care Insurance Contracts, with your return.

Although a partnership generally pays no tax, it must file an information return on Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, and send Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) to each partner. In addition, the partnership will send each partner a copy of the Partner's Instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) to help each partner report his or her share of the partnership's income, deductions, credits, and tax preference items. For more information on partnerships, see Publication 541, Partnerships."
668,Chapter 12,Other income,Partnership Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"General. A partnership includes a group, pool, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization that carries on a business or financial operation. Most entities that qualify for partnership treatment can elect out of partnership treatment under the “check-the-box” regulations. See your tax advisor for more information. Limited liability companies. All states permit the formation of limited liability companies (LLCs). In an LLC, members and designated managers are not personally liable for any debts of the company. Absent an election to the contrary the entity will generally be treated as a partnership and, as a result, enjoy the same federal income tax benefits that apply to partnerships. If the entity is appropriately established, LLCs combine the benefits of corporate limited liability with the advantages of partnership taxation. In addition to LLCs, one may consider the formation of a limited liability partnership (LLP). Consult your tax advisor or attorney to find out if these are options for your business in the state you live in. Reporting income. Because a partnership is not a taxable entity, all tax items are passed through to the partners. A partnership is required to give you a Schedule K-1, Partner's Share of Income, Credits, Deductions, etc. A Schedule K-1 will list your distributive share of income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits that is required to be included in your individual tax return. If, for example, the Schedule K-1 indicates interest income of $100, you will need to include $100 as interest income on your Schedule B, Form 1040 or 1040A. (See chapter 7, Interest income.) Basis. Because the partnership's income and losses flow directly through to you, that income or loss will affect your tax basis in the partnership. It is important that you maintain and update this tax-basis calculation every year for two reasons. First, your distributive share of the partnership losses is limited to the adjusted basis of your interest in the partnership at the end of the partnership year in which the losses took place. Second, in the year you sell your partnership interest, you will need to know your tax basis in order to calculate your gain or loss. To determine the adjusted basis of your interest in the partnership, begin with your initial investment and your initial share of the partnership's liabilities and make the following adjustments. Additions to basis 1.    Your distributive share of the partnership's taxable income 2.    Your share of any tax-exempt income earned by the partnership 3.    Your share of the excess of partnership deductions for depletion over the basis of partnership property subject to depletion 4.    Any additional capital you contribute 5.    Your share of any increase in partnership liabilities Subtractions from basis 1.  Any cash distributions you receive 2.  The basis that you take in any property distributed to you by the partnership 3.  Your share of oil and gas depletion claimed by the partnership 4.  Your distributive share of partnership deductions, losses, and certain credits 5.  Your share of nondeductible, noncapital expenditures made by the partnership 6.  Your share of any decrease in partnership liabilities The partnership agreement usually covers the distribution of profits, losses, and other items. However, if there is no agreement for sharing a specific item of gain or loss, generally, each partner's distributive share is figured according to the partner's interest in the partnership. In addition, special “at-risk” rules apply to a partnership engaged in any activity. You may deduct your share of a partnership loss from any activity only up to the total amount that you are at risk in the activity at the end of the partnership's tax year. The amount you are at risk in an activity is the cash and the adjusted basis of other property you contributed to the activity. Also, you are at risk for any amounts borrowed for use in the activity for which you either are personally liable or have pledged property, except property used in the activity, as security. Generally, you are not at risk for: 1.    Any nonrecourse loans used to finance the activity, to acquire property used in the activity, or to acquire your interest in the activity, unless they are secured by property not used in the activity; 2.    Amounts for which you are protected against loss by guarantees, stop-loss agreements, or other similar arrangements; or 3.    Amounts borrowed from interested or related parties if your partnership is engaged in certain activities. For more information on the at-risk rules, see Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules. In addition to the factors discussed above, your amount at risk is affected by the operating results of the activity itself. Income from the activity increases the amount you are at risk. Losses from the activity decrease the amount you are at risk. The at-risk amount is determined at the end of each tax year. Any loss in excess of that amount is disallowed for that year. It may, however, be carried over to future years, and to the extent that you subsequently have amounts at risk, it may be deducted in those years. Under prior law, a partnership engaged in real estate activity was not subject to the at-risk rules. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 extended the at-risk rules to include real estate activities placed in service after December 31, 1986, but made exceptions for third-party nonrecourse debt from commercial lenders and certain other parties. In addition to the at-risk rules, the income from real estate partnerships is also subject to the passive activity rules. See Passive Activity Limitations and At-Risk Limitations, at the end of this chapter. Also, consult your tax advisor for further information. When to report partnership income. Generally, you must include your distributive share of partnership items on your return for the tax year in which the last day of the partnership year falls. (See chapter 44, Decedents: Dealing with the death of a family member, for exceptions relating to partnership interests held by a decedent.) If you receive income from a partnership other than in your capacity as a partner, however, you must report the income in the year in which it was received. For instance, if you sell property to your partnership at a gain, the gain is generally included in income when you receive the sales proceeds, regardless of when your partnership's tax year ends. Estimated tax payments. A partner must take into account his or her share of the partnership's income or deductions to date at each estimated tax payment date. Often, this information is not readily available. If you are a member of a partnership you may protect yourself from underpayment penalties by basing your payments on one of the exceptions described in chapter 4, Tax withholding and estimated tax. However, additional issues arise if an individual's residence changes during the year. An individual's resident state income tax return generally must include all the income the individual recognized during the year. A part-year resident would include all income recognized during the period of residency, as well as income sourced to that state during the period of nonresidency. The state tax treatment of flow-through entity income for a part-year resident varies from state to state. You should review the rules for the state(s) in which you reside for guidance. Sale of partnership interest. If you have a gain or a loss from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest, it is treated as a gain or a loss from the sale of a capital asset. The gain or loss is the difference between the amount you receive and the adjusted basis of your interest in the partnership. If you are relieved of any debts of the partnership, you must include these debts in the amount you receive. However, you may have ordinary income as well as capital gain or loss on the sale of your partnership interest if the sale involves uncollected accounts receivable or inventory items that have increased in value. Consult your tax advisor for further help."
669,Chapter 12,Other income,Partnership Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Qualified joint venture. If you and your spouse each materially participate as the only members of a jointly owned and operated business, and you file a joint return for the tax year, you can make a joint election to be treated as a qualified joint venture instead of a partnership. To make this election, you must divide all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit attributable to the business between you and your spouse in accordance with your respective interests in the venture. For further information on how to make the election and which schedule(s) to file, see the instructions for your individual tax return."
670,Chapter 12,Other income,S Corporation Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"In most cases, an S corporation does not pay tax on its income. Instead, the income, losses, deductions, and credits of the corporation are passed through to the shareholders based on each shareholder's pro rata share."

672,Chapter 12,Other income,S Corporation Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Schedule K-1 (Form 1120S). An S corporation must file a return on Form 1120S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation, and send Schedule K-1 (Form 1120S) to each shareholder. In addition, the S corporation will send each shareholder a copy of the Shareholder's Instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 1120S) to help each shareholder report his or her share of the S corporation's income, losses, credits, and deductions. For more information on S corporations and their shareholders, see the Instructions for Form 1120S."
673,Chapter 12,Other income,S Corporation Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Shareholder's return. Generally, S corporation distributions are considered a nontaxable return of your basis in the corporation's stock. However, in certain cases, part of the distributions may be taxable as a dividend or as a long-term or short-term capital gain, or as both. The corporation's distributions may be in the form of cash or property. All current-year income or loss and other tax items are taxed to you at the corporation's year-end. Generally, the items that are passed through to you as a shareholder will increase or decrease the basis of your S corporation stock as appropriate. Dividends are paid only from prior-year earnings (generally retained earnings from years prior to becoming an S corporation). Generally, property (including cash) distributions, except dividend distributions, are considered a return of capital to the extent of your basis in the stock of the corporation. Distributions in excess of basis are treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of property. You should receive from each S corporation in which you are a shareholder a copy of the Shareholder's Instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 1120S), together with a copy of Schedule K-1 (Form 1120S), showing your share of the income, credits, and deductions of the S corporation for the tax year. Your distributive share of the items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of the S corporation must be shown separately on your Form 1040 or 1040A. The tax treatment of these items generally is the same as if you had realized or incurred them personally. Individuals form an S corporation to get the legal benefits of a corporation, such as limited liability, while retaining the tax benefits of an individual. Usually, an S corporation does not pay federal income tax. One exception is a tax on net passive investment income that is paid by the S corporation, but normally, the individual owners of the corporation pay tax or accrue tax benefits on their personal returns based on the corporation's profits and losses. Income from an S corporation is included in an individual's return as if the S corporation did not exist. Dividends that the S corporation receives are included as dividends on your return on Schedule B (Form 1040). Capital gains are included on Schedule D (Form 1040). Items of income from an S corporation that are not separately stated on an individual's return, such as interest, dividends, and capital gains/losses, are combined and included on Schedule E (Form 1040). If you have losses from an S corporation when you are not an active participant in the corporation's business activities, your losses will be subject to the passive activity loss limitations. See the section on Passive Activity Losses at the end of this chapter. Estimated tax payments. A shareholder must take into account his or her share of the S corporation's income or deductions to date at each estimated tax payment date. Often, this information is not readily available. If you are a member of an S corporation, you may protect yourself from underpayment penalties by basing your payments on one of the exceptions described in chapter 4, Tax withholding and estimated tax. Generally, an S corporation must have its tax year-end on December 31. However, under certain circumstances, an S corporation may operate on a fiscal year; that is, its tax year may end on a date other than December 31. Your return should include all S corporation income for its operating year that ends within your tax year. Example If your S corporation's year ends on October 31, your return for 2016 will include the income items for the corporation's entire year that ended October 31, 2016, even though that means including 2 months of 2015. Deducting losses. You may deduct any losses of the S corporation for the year up to the amount of your basis. Basis in an S corporation. Your basis in an S corporation at the end of a year is your investment (basis of stock owned plus loans made directly by you to the S corporation), with the following adjustments: Additions to basis 1.    Your distributive share of the S corporation's separately and non-separately stated taxable income 2.    Your share of tax-exempt income earned by the S corporation 3.    Any additional capital that you contribute 4.    Deductions for depletion in excess of the basis of the property 5.    A loan to the corporation directly from the shareholder; however, a guarantee of a third-party loan by a shareholder does not qualify as an addition to basis Subtractions from basis 1.    Generally, any cash distributed and the fair market value of property distributed (other than taxable dividends), but not below zero 2.    Your distributive share of the S corporation's separately and non-separately stated items of loss, deductions, and certain credits 3.    Your share of nondeductible, noncapital expenditures made by the S corporation 4.    Your share of the deductions for depletion for any oil and gas property held by the S corporation to the extent that the deduction does not exceed the proportionate share of the property's adjusted basis allocated to you Example 1 Your basis in an S corporation is $20,000. The corporation makes a distribution to you of $30,000 in cash or property. You would have to recognize income of $10,000 due to a distribution in excess of basis. Example 2 Your basis in an S corporation is $20,000. If it reports losses of $30,000, you may deduct only $20,000 for the year. The other $10,000 of losses is carried over to subsequent tax years and deducted in the year you have more basis."
674,Chapter 12,Other income,S Corporation Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"An S corporation is just one of several alternatives to consider as a vehicle to conduct business activities, but it does offer some of the best features of a regular corporation, a partnership, and a sole proprietorship. 1.    As in a regular corporation, the stockholders of an S corporation are normally immune from liabilities in excess of their investment. 2.    Like a regular corporation, the S corporation structure is convenient for transferring equity to heirs as part of your estate planning and the gradual transition of management and control to your heirs or successors (see chapter 45, Estate and gift tax planning, for further information). As shareholders, the heirs then report their proportionate share of S corporation income and losses on their respective tax returns. 3.    Like a partnership or sole proprietorship, the S corporation permits the investors to deduct operating losses. Just as important, profits are not taxed twice, as they are in a regular corporation. A regular corporation itself pays taxes, and so do the individuals who receive a share of those profits when dividends are paid. An S corporation is, except in certain circumstances, exempt from taxes—at least at the federal level."
675,Chapter 12,Other income,Recoveries,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"A recovery is a return of an amount you deducted or took a credit for in an earlier year. The most common recoveries are refunds, reimbursements, and rebates of deductions itemized on Schedule A (Form 1040). You also may have recoveries of nonitemized deductions (such as payments on previously deducted bad debts) and recoveries of items for which you previously claimed a tax credit. Tax benefit rule. You must include a recovery in your income in the year you receive it up to the amount by which the deduction or credit you took for the recovered amount reduced your tax in the earlier year. For this purpose, any increase to an amount carried over to the current year that resulted from the deduction or credit is considered to have reduced your tax in the earlier year. For more information, see Publication 525. Federal income tax refund. Refunds of federal income taxes are not included in your income because they are never allowed as a deduction from income. State tax refund. If you received a state or local income tax refund (or credit or offset) in 2016, you generally must include it in income if you deducted the tax in an earlier year. The payer should send Form 1099-G, Certain Government Payments, to you by January 31, 2017. The IRS also will receive a copy of the Form 1099-G. If you file Form 1040, use the State and Local Income Tax Refund Worksheet in the 2016 Form 1040 instructions for line 10 to figure the amount (if any) to include in your income. See Publication 525 for when you must use another worksheet."
676,Chapter 12,Other income,Recoveries,,EY,TAXORGANIZER,"Many states are no longer sending the Form 1099-G in paper form to taxpayers. To receive a copy of the 1099-G, which reports state tax refunds, the taxpayer in these states must go to their state tax department or department of revenue website to print a copy of the form for their records."
677,Chapter 12,Other income,Recoveries,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you could choose to deduct for a tax year either: §  State and local income taxes, or §  State and local general sales taxes, then the maximum refund that you may have to include in income is limited to the excess of the tax you chose to deduct for that year over the tax you did not choose to deduct for that year. For examples, see Publication 525. Mortgage interest refund. If you received a refund or credit in 2016 of mortgage interest paid in an earlier year, the amount should be shown in box 3 of your Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement. Do not subtract the refund amount from the interest you paid in 2016. You may have to include it in your income under the rules explained in the following discussions. Interest on recovery. Interest on any of the amounts you recover must be reported as interest income in the year received. For example, report any interest you received on state or local income tax refunds on Form 1040, line 8a."
678,Chapter 12,Other income,Recoveries,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Although the amount of a state tax refund may not be included in gross income, any interest you receive on federal or state tax refunds is taxable."
679,Chapter 12,Other income,Recoveries,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Recovery and expense in same year. If the refund or other recovery and the expense occur in the same year, the recovery reduces the deduction or credit and is not reported as income. Recovery for 2 or more years. If you receive a refund or other recovery that is for amounts you paid in 2 or more separate years, you must allocate, on a pro rata basis, the recovered amount between the years in which you paid it. This allocation is necessary to determine the amount of recovery from any earlier years and to determine the amount, if any, of your allowable deduction for this item for the current year. For information on how to compute the allocation, see Recoveries in Publication 525."
680,Chapter 12,Other income,Recoveries,Itemized Deduction Recoveries,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you recover any amount that you deducted in an earlier year on Schedule A (Form 1040), you generally must include the full amount of the recovery in your income in the year you receive it. Where to report. Enter your state or local income tax refund on Form 1040, line 10, and the total of all other recoveries as other income on Form 1040, line 21. You cannot use Form 1040A or Form 1040EZ. Standard deduction limit. You generally are allowed to claim the standard deduction if you do not itemize your deductions. Only your itemized deductions that are more than your standard deduction are subject to the recovery rule (unless you are required to itemize your deductions). If your total deductions on the earlier year return were not more than your income for that year, include in your income this year the lesser of: §  Your recoveries, or §  The amount by which your itemized deductions exceeded the standard deduction. Example. For 2015, you filed a joint return. Your taxable income was $60,000 and you were not entitled to any tax credits. Your standard deduction was $12,600, and you had itemized deductions of $14,200. In 2016, you received the following recoveries for amounts deducted on your 2015 return: Medical expenses $200 State and local income tax refund 400 Refund of mortgage interest 325 Total recoveries $925 None of the recoveries were more than the deductions taken for 2015. The difference between the state and local income tax you deducted and your local general sales tax was more than $400. Your total recoveries are less than the amount by which your itemized deductions exceeded the standard deduction ($14,200 −12,600 = $1,600), so you must include your total recoveries in your income for 2016. Report the state and local income tax refund of $400 on Form 1040, line 10, and the balance of your recoveries, $525, on Form 1040, line 21."
681,Chapter 12,Other income,Recoveries,Itemized Deduction Recoveries,EY,TAXPLANNER,"The IRS correctly points out that the recovery of certain amounts you deducted is not income if you did not itemize your deductions in the year in which you paid these expenses. However, if the payer of the refund submits a Form 1099 or Form 1099-G to the IRS, we suggest that you attach a statement to your return including the item in income and then subtracting it out explaining why the item does not represent taxable income. This may prevent an inquiry from the IRS. If you were subject to the alternative minimum tax in 2015, you may not have obtained any benefit for all or part of your state income tax deduction. This is because state income taxes are not deductible for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax. (The alternative minimum tax is explained in chapter 31, How to figure your tax.) You will want to compute carefully the amount of the refund you received in 2016 that did not give you any tax benefit in 2015. Attach a statement in your return explaining why the item does not represent taxable income. This will require a “with-and-without” computation. If your prior-year tax was not lower with the deduction, you did not receive a benefit, and, therefore, the refund is not taxable income when received."
682,Chapter 12,Other income,Recoveries,Itemized Deduction Recoveries,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Standard deduction for earlier years. To determine if amounts recovered in 2016 must be included in your income, you must know the standard deduction for your filing status for the year the deduction was claimed. Look in the instructions for your tax return from prior years to locate the standard deduction for the filing status for that prior year."
683,Chapter 12,Other income,Recoveries,Itemized Deduction Recoveries,EY,EXPLANATION,The following table can be used as a reference to determine the amount of standard deduction allowed in previous years.

You filed a joint return on Form 1040 for 2015 with taxable income of $45,000. Your itemized deductions were $12,850. The standard deduction that you could have claimed was $12,600. In 2016, you recovered $2,100 of your 2015 itemized deductions. None of the recoveries were more than the actual deductions for 2015. Include $250 of the recoveries in your 2016 income. This is the smaller of your recoveries ($2,100) or the amount by which your itemized deductions were more than the standard deduction ($12,850 – $12,600 = $250)."
685,Chapter 12,Other income,Recoveries,Itemized Deduction Recoveries,EY,EXPLANATION,"Sometimes you get some money back in a year after you paid and deducted it (e.g., a refund of state income tax or real estate tax). To the extent that you got a tax benefit in the earlier year, and only to that extent, you must include the refund in income. Example In 2016, Stan and Lori received a refund of $1,000 for real estate taxes they paid in 2015. In 2015, they reported $12,750 in itemized deductions, all of which was from their real estate taxes. The standard deduction for 2015was $12,600. Because they only have to report the amount of the refund to the extent they received a tax benefit in 2015, they would include $150 ($12,750 − $12,600) of the refund in income in 2015."
686,Chapter 12,Other income,Recoveries,Itemized Deduction Recoveries,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Recovery limited to deduction. You do not include in your income any amount of your recovery that is more than the amount you deducted in the earlier year. The amount you include in your income is limited to the smaller of: §  The amount deducted on Schedule A (Form 1040), or §  The amount recovered. Example. During 2015 you paid $1,700 for medical expenses. Of this amount, you deducted $200 on your 2015 Schedule A. In 2016, you received a $500 reimbursement from your medical insurance for your 2015 expenses. The only amount of the $500 reimbursement that must be included in your income for 2016 is $200—the amount actually deducted. Other recoveries. See Recoveries in Publication 525 if: §  You have recoveries of items other than itemized deductions, or §  You received a recovery for an item for which you claimed a tax credit (other than investment credit or foreign tax credit) in a prior year."

In most cases, if your primary purpose is income or profit and you are involved in the rental activity with continuity and regularity, your rental activity is a business. See Publication 535, Business Expenses, for details on deducting expenses for both business and not-for-profit activities. Reporting business income and expenses.

If you rent personal property for profit, include your rental expenses in the total amount you enter on Form 1040, line 36, and see the instructions there. If you do not rent personal property for profit, your deductions are limited and you cannot report a loss to offset other income. See Activity not for profit, under Other Income, later."
688,Chapter 12,Other income,Prepayments,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"If you had to repay an amount that you included in your income in an earlier year, you may be able to deduct the amount repaid from your income for the year in which you repaid it. Or, if the amount you repaid is more than $3,000, you may be able to take a credit against your tax for the year in which you repaid it. Generally, you can claim a deduction or credit only if the repayment qualifies as an expense or loss incurred in your trade or business or in a for-profit transaction. Type of deduction. The type of deduction you are allowed in the year of repayment depends on the type of income you included in the earlier year. You generally deduct the repayment on the same form or schedule on which you previously reported it as income. For example, if you reported it as self-employment income, deduct it as a business expense on Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040) or Schedule F (Form 1040). If you reported it as a capital gain, deduct it as a capital loss as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). If you reported it as wages, unemployment compensation, or other nonbusiness income, deduct it as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040). Repaid social security benefits. If you repaid social security benefits or equivalent railroad retirement benefits, see Repayment of benefits in Chapter 11. Repayment of $3,000 or less. If the amount you repaid was $3,000 or less, deduct it from your income in the year you repaid it. If you must deduct it as a miscellaneous itemized deduction, enter it on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 23. Repayment over $3,000. If the amount you repaid was more than $3,000, you can deduct the repayment (as explained under Type of deduction, earlier). However, you can choose instead to take a tax credit for the year of repayment if you included the income under a claim of right. This means that at the time you included the income, it appeared that you had an unrestricted right to it. If you qualify for this choice, figure your tax under both methods and compare the results. Use the method (deduction or credit) that results in less tax."
689,Chapter 12,Other income,Prepayments,,EY,Caution,"When determining whether the amount you repaid was more or less than $3,000, consider the total amount being repaid on the return. Each instance of repayment is not considered separately."
690,Chapter 12,Other income,Prepayments,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Method 1. Figure your tax for 2016 claiming a deduction for the repaid amount. If you must deduct it as a miscellaneous itemized deduction, enter it on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 28. Method 2. Figure your tax for 2016 claiming a credit for the repaid amount. Follow these steps. 1.    Figure your tax for 2016 without deducting the repaid amount. 2.    Refigure your tax from the earlier year without including in income the amount you repaid in 2016. 3.    Subtract the tax in (2) from the tax shown on your return for the earlier year. This is the credit. 4.    Subtract the answer in (3) from the tax for 2016 figured without the deduction (Step 1). If method 1 results in less tax, deduct the amount repaid. If method 2 results in less tax, claim the credit figured in (3) above on Form 1040, line 73, by adding the amount of the credit to any other credits on this line, and see the instructions there. An example of this computation can be found in Publication 525."
691,Chapter 12,Other income,Prepayments,,EY,EXAMPLE,"For tax year 2015, you were married with no dependents. You filed a joint return with your spouse and reported taxable income of $90,000 (after all deductions and exemptions). Your return showed a tax liability of $14,094, which you paid. In 2016, you had to return $5,000 that you had received and had included in your 2015 gross income. Your marital and filing statuses were the same in 2016 as in 2015, and your taxable income for 2016 is $160,000 (after all deductions and exemptions and assuming all income is taxed at ordinary tax rates). To determine how to treat the repayment on your 2015 return, the following calculations must be performed."
692,Chapter 12,Other income,Prepayments,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Method 1  2016 taxable income $160,000 Less: Deduction for repayment −5,000 Revised 2016 taxable income $155,000 Tax using method 1 $30,386 Method 2  2016 taxable income $160,000 Recomputed 2016 tax liability $31,786 (a) 2015 taxable income as previously reported $90,000 Less: Deduction for repayment −5,000 2015 taxable income w/out repayment $85,000 Recomputed 2015 tax liability $12,844 (b) 2015 tax as reported $14,094 Recomputed 2015 tax liability (w/out repayment) −12,844 Difference $ 1,250 (c) Recomputed 2016 tax liability $31,786 Difference from (b) −1,250 Tax using method 2 $30,536 To determine which method should be used to account for your repayment in 2016, you must now compare the two methods and choose the one that generates the lower tax liability. In the example, method 1 generates the lesser tax liability; therefore, you would deduct the amount repaid by you in 2016 on your 2016 tax return. Note that these two methods will only result in different tax liabilities if you fall into different marginal tax brackets in each year (e.g., in 2015, you are in the 25% marginal tax bracket, and in 2016, you are in the 28% marginal tax bracket)."
693,Chapter 12,Other income,Prepayments,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Repaid wages subject to social security and Medicare taxes. If you had to repay an amount that you included in your wages or compensation in an earlier year on which social security, Medicare, or tier 1 RRTA taxes were paid, ask your employer to refund the excess amount to you. If the employer refuses to refund the taxes, ask for a statement indicating the amount of the overcollection to support your claim. File a claim for refund using Form 843, Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement. Repaid wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax. Employers cannot make an adjustment or file a claim for refund for Additional Medicare Tax withholding when there is a repayment of wages received by an employee in a prior year because the employee determines liability for Additional Medicare Tax on the employee's income tax return for the prior year. If you had to repay an amount that you included in your wages or compensation in an earlier year, and on which Additional Medicare Tax was paid, you may be able to recover the Additional Medicare Tax paid on the amount. To recover Additional Medicare Tax on the repaid wages or compensation, you must file Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, for the prior year in which the wages or compensation were originally received. See the Instructions for Form 1040X."
694,Chapter 12,Other income,Royalties,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Royalties from copyrights, patents, and oil, gas, and mineral properties are taxable as ordinary income.

Copyrights and patents. Royalties from copyrights on literary, musical, or artistic works, and similar property, or from patents on inventions, are amounts paid to you for the right to use your work over a specified period of time.

697,Chapter 12,Other income,Royalties,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Income derived by an individual from a working interest in an oil or gas property is reported on Schedule C and is generally subject to self-employment tax, even though you may not actively participate in the operations that produce the income. Such income, however, is not eligible for individual retirement arrangement (IRA) or Keogh plan contributions, because it is not earned by personal services you performed."
698,Chapter 12,Other income,Royalties,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Depletion. If you are the owner of an economic interest in mineral deposits or oil and gas wells, you can recover your investment through the depletion allowance. For information on this subject, see chapter 9 of Publication 535. Coal and iron ore. Under certain circumstances, you can treat amounts you receive from the disposal of coal and iron ore as payments from the sale of a capital asset, rather than as royalty income. For information about gain or loss from the sale of coal and iron ore, see Publication 544, chapter 2. Sale of property interest. If you sell your complete interest in oil, gas, or mineral rights, the amount you receive is considered payment for the sale of property used in a trade or business under Section 1231, not royalty income. Under certain circumstances, the sale is subject to capital gain or loss treatment as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). For more information on selling Section 1231 property, see chapter 3 of Publication 544. If you retain a royalty, an overriding royalty, or a net profit interest in a mineral property for the life of the property, you have made a lease or a sublease, and any cash you receive for the assignment of other interests in the property is ordinary income subject to a depletion allowance."
699,Chapter 12,Other income,Royalties,,EY,EXPLANATION,"The sale of most items producing royalty income is treated as a capital transaction. However, this is not true for copyrights and other property created by your personal efforts.

700,Chapter 12,Other income,Royalties,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Part of future production sold. If you own mineral property but sell part of the future production, in most cases you treat the money you receive from the buyer at the time of the sale as a loan from the buyer. Do not include it in your income or take depletion based on it. When production begins, you include all the proceeds in your income, deduct all the production expenses, and deduct depletion from that amount to arrive at your taxable income from the property."
701,Chapter 12,Other income,Royalties,,EY,EXPLANATION,"If you are paid royalties or bonuses for the production of oil before production actually begins, you may qualify for a depletion allowance in the year in which the advance royalty or bonus is included in your income.

If you have a disability, you must include in income compensation you receive for services you perform unless the compensation is otherwise excluded. However, you do not include in income the value of goods, services, and cash that you receive, not in return for your services, but for your training and rehabilitation because you have a disability. Excludable amounts include payments for transportation and attendant care, such as interpreter services for the deaf, reader services for the blind, and services to help individuals with an intellectual disability do their work. Disaster relief grants. Do not include post-disaster grants received under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act in your income if the grant payments are made to help you meet necessary expenses or serious needs for medical, dental, housing, personal property, transportation, child care, or funeral expenses. Do not deduct casualty losses or medical expenses that are specifically reimbursed by these disaster relief grants. If you have deducted a casualty loss for the loss of your personal residence and you later receive a disaster relief grant for the loss of the same residence, you may have to include part or all of the grant in your taxable income.

A relocation payment under section 105(a)(11) of the Housing and Community Development Act made by a local jurisdiction to a displaced individual moving from a flood-damaged residence to another residence is not includible in the recipient's gross income. Home rehabilitation grants received by low-income homeowners in a defined area under the same act are also not includible in such homeowner's gross income."
711,Chapter 12,Other income,Welfare and Other Public Assistance Benefits,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Medicare. Medicare benefits received under title XVIII of the Social Security Act are not includible in the gross income of the individuals for whom they are paid. This includes basic (part A (Hospital Insurance Benefits for the Aged)) and supplementary (part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance Benefits for the Aged)). Social security benefits (including lump-sum payments attributable to prior years), Supplemental Security Income benefits, and lump-sum death benefits. The Social Security Administration (SSA) provides benefits such as old-age benefits, benefits to disabled workers, and benefits to spouses and dependents. These benefits may be subject to federal income tax depending on your filing status and other income. See chapter 11, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement, in this publication and Publication 915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits, for more information. An individual originally denied benefits, but later approved, may receive a lump-sum payment for the period when benefits were denied (which may be prior years). See Publication 915 for information on how to make a lump-sum election, which may reduce your tax liability. There are also other types of benefits paid by the SSA. However, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and lump-sum death benefits (one-time payment to spouse and children of deceased) are not subject to federal income tax. For more information on these benefits, go to www.socialsecurity.gov. Nutrition Program for the Elderly. Food benefits you receive under the Nutrition Program for the Elderly are not taxable.

712,Chapter 12,Other income,Welfare and Other Public Assistance Benefits,,EY,Other Sickness and Injury Benefits,"In addition to welfare or insurance benefits, you may receive other payments for sickness or injury. Workers’ compensation. Amounts you receive as workers’ compensation for an occupational sickness or injury are fully exempt from tax if they are paid under a workers’ compensation act or a statute in the nature of a workers’ compensation act. The exemption also applies to your survivor(s). The exemption from tax, however, does not apply to retirement benefits you receive based on your age, length of service, or prior contributions to the plan, even if you retired because of occupational sickness or injury. Note: If part of your workers’ compensation reduces your social security or equivalent railroad retirement benefits received, that part is considered social security (or equivalent railroad retirement) benefits and may be taxable. For more information, see Publication 915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits. Return to work. If you return to work after qualifying for workers’ compensation, payments you continue to receive while assigned to light duties are taxable. Report these payments as wages on line 7 of Form 1040 or Form 1040A or on line 1 of Form 1040EZ. Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA). Payments received under this Act for personal injury or sickness, including payments to beneficiaries in case of death, are not taxable. However, you are taxed on amounts you receive under this Act as “continuation of pay” for up to 45 days while a claim is being decided. Report this income on line 7 of Form 1040 or Form 1040A or on line 1 of Form 1040EZ. Also, pay for sick leave while a claim is being processed is taxable and must be included in your income as wages. The IRS has ruled that the subsidized portion of health benefits provided by an employer to an employee's domestic partner, who does not qualify as a spouse or a dependent, will be taxable as wages to the employee. You can deduct the amount you spend to “buy back” sick leave for an earlier year to be eligible for nontaxable FECA benefits for that period. It is a miscellaneous deduction subject to the 2% limit on Schedule A (Form 1040). If you buy back sick leave in the same year you use it, the amount reduces your taxable sick leave pay. Do not deduct it separately. Other compensation. Many other amounts you receive as compensation for injury or illness are not taxable. These include: Compensatory damages you receive for physical injury or physical illness, whether paid in a lump sum or in periodic payments, Benefits you receive under an accident or health insurance policy on which either you paid the premiums or your employer paid the premiums but you had to include them in your gross income, Disability benefits you receive for loss of income or earning capacity as a result of injuries under a “no-fault” car insurance policy, and Compensation you receive for permanent loss or loss of use of a part or function of your body, or for your permanent disfigurement. This compensation must be based only on the injury and not on the period of your absence from work. These benefits are exempt from tax even if your employer pays for the accident and health plan that provides these benefits. Only damages received on account of personal physical injury or sickness are nontaxable. Punitive damages will be taxable except those received in a wrongful death action where state law stipulates that they are nontaxable. This law is effective for amounts received after August 20, 1996, unless there was a binding settlement in effect on September 13, 1995. Reimbursement for medical care. A reimbursement for medical care is generally not taxable. However, this reimbursement may reduce your medical expense deduction.

714,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"The following brief discussions are arranged in alphabetical order. Other income items briefly discussed below are referenced to publications which provide more topical information. Activity not for profit. You must include on your return income from an activity from which you do not expect to make a profit. An example of this type of activity is a hobby or a farm you operate mostly for recreation and pleasure. Enter this income on Form 1040, line 21. Deductions for expenses related to the activity are limited. They cannot total more than the income you report and can be taken only if you itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). See Not-for-Profit Activities in chapter 1 of Publication 535 for information on whether an activity is considered carried on for a profit."
715,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"An activity will be presumed to have been for profit if it results in a profit in at least 3 out of 5 consecutive tax years whether the activity is held individually, in trust, as a partnership, or as an S corporation. However, for the breeding, training, showing, or racing of horses, the activity must result in a profit in at least 2 out of 7 consecutive tax years. If the activity meets this test, it is presumed to be carried on for profit and the limits will not apply. If you have engaged in an activity for less than 3 years, you can postpone the determination that the activity is not for profit by filing Form 5213, Election to Postpone Determination with Respect to the Presumption That an Activity Is Engaged in for Profit. Get Publication 535, Business Expenses, for more information. It is possible that the IRS may treat you as engaged in a profit-making activity, even if you do not have a profit for 3 or more years during a period of 5 consecutive tax years. The IRS determines the activity's status—for profit or as a hobby—by considering the facts and circumstances surrounding the case. Some factors that will be considered include the following: 1.    The manner in which you carry on the activity. For example, do you conduct your actions in a business-like manner (records, activity details, separate bank accounts, etc.)? 2.    The level of expertise possessed by you and your advisors 3.    The time and effort you expend in carrying on the activity 4.    Any expectations you have that assets used in the activity may appreciate in value 5.    Prior success in similar or dissimilar activities 6.    Your history of income or loss with respect to the activity 7.    The amount of occasional profits, if any, that you earn through the activity 8.    Your financial status. For example, the fact that you do not have substantial income from other sources may indicate that you are engaging in the activity for profit 9.    Elements of personal pleasure or recreation These factors are not exclusive, and no one factor or number of factors is determinative."
716,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"If an activity does show a profit for any 3 of 5 consecutive years (2 of 7 years for horse farms), there is a presumption by law that you are engaged in the activity for profit. The IRS has the burden of proving that the activity is only a hobby. However, if you do not meet the 3-year test and the IRS determines that the activity is a hobby, then you have the burden of proving your profit motive. You would normally not file Form 5213, Election to Postpone Determination with Respect to the Presumption That an Activity Is Engaged in for Profit, until the IRS has examined records from one of the early years in which you engaged in the activity and has concluded that it is a hobby. Then, to prevent the IRS from assessing a tax on the years under examination, you should file Form 5213. However, by filing the form, you agree to extend the period for which the IRS may collect additional taxes by disallowing the losses until 2 years after the examination period is over. Also, by filing, you virtually guarantee that the IRS will carefully examine all years during the period under examination. Because the IRS previously concluded that the activity is a hobby, it is almost certain to reach the same conclusion again."
717,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Alaska Permanent Fund dividend. If you received a payment from Alaska's mineral income fund (Alaska Permanent Fund dividend), report it as income on line 21 of Form 1040, line 13 of Form 1040A, or line 3 of Form 1040EZ. The state of Alaska sends each recipient a document that shows the amount of the payment with the check. The amount also is reported to IRS. Alimony. Include in your income on Form 1040, line 11, any alimony payments you receive. Amounts you receive for child support are not income to you. Alimony and child support payments are discussed in chapter 18."
718,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"While alimony payments you receive are taxable, property settlements arising out of divorce are not. You should bear this in mind when considering the tax consequences of a divorce. See chapter 18, Alimony, for more details."

720,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Bribes. If you receive a bribe, include it in your income. Campaign contributions. These contributions are not income to a candidate unless they are diverted to his or her personal use. To be nontaxable, the contributions must be spent for campaign purposes or kept in a fund for use in future campaigns. However, interest earned on bank deposits, dividends received on contributed securities, and net gains realized on sales of contributed securities are taxable and must be reported on Form 1120-POL, U.S. Income Tax Return for Certain Political Organizations. Excess campaign funds transferred to an office account must be included in the officeholder's income on Form 1040, line 21, in the year transferred. Car pools. Do not include in your income amounts you receive from the passengers for driving a car in a car pool to and from work. These amounts are considered reimbursement for your expenses. However, this rule does not apply if you have developed car pool arrangements into a profit-making business of transporting workers for hire. Cash rebates. A cash rebate you receive from a dealer or manufacturer of an item you buy is not income, but you must reduce your basis by the amount of the rebate. Example. You buy a new car for $24,000 cash and receive a $2,000 rebate check from the manufacturer. The $2,000 is not income to you. Your basis in the car is $22,000. This is the basis on which you figure gain or loss if you sell the car and depreciation if you use it for business."
721,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"The IRS views rebates as another way of offering a price reduction to induce you to buy a product. Similarly, the dividends that a life insurance company pays you are a reduction of your premium rather than an addition to your gross income. The same rule applies to any cash rebates you might receive from your credit card company for using its card."
722,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Casualty insurance and other reimbursements. You generally should not report these reimbursements on your return unless you are figuring gain or loss from the casualty or theft. See chapter 26 for more information. Child support payments. You should not report these payments on your return. See chapter 18 for more information. Court awards and damages. To determine if settlement amounts you receive by compromise or judgment must be included in your income, you must consider the item that the settlement replaces. The character of the income as ordinary income or capital gain depends on the nature of the underlying claim. Include the following as ordinary income. 1.    Interest on any award. 2.    Compensation for lost wages or lost profits in most cases. 3.    Punitive damages, in most cases. It does not matter if they relate to a physical injury or physical sickness. 4.    Amounts received in settlement of pension rights (if you did not contribute to the plan). 5.    Damages for: a.       Patent or copyright infringement, b.      Breach of contract, or c.       Interference with business operations. 6.    Back pay and damages for emotional distress received to satisfy a claim under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 7.    Attorney fees and costs (including contingent fees) where the underlying recovery is included in gross income. Do not include in your income compensatory damages for personal physical injury or physical sickness (whether received in a lump sum or installments). Emotional distress. Emotional distress itself is not a physical injury or physical sickness, but damages you receive for emotional distress due to a physical injury or sickness are treated as received for the physical injury or sickness. Do not include them in your income. If the emotional distress is due to a personal injury that is not due to a physical injury or sickness (for example, employment discrimination or injury to reputation), you must include the damages in your income, except for any damages that are not more than amounts paid for medical care due to that emotional distress. Emotional distress includes physical symptoms that result from emotional distress, such as headaches, insomnia, and stomach disorders."
723,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"The tax law states that only damages received on account of personal injury or sickness are nontaxable. Punitive damages will be taxable, unless they are received in a wrongful death action for which state law stipulates as of September 13, 1995, that only punitive damages may be awarded. This law is effective for amounts received after August 20, 1996, unless there was a binding settlement in effect on September 13, 1995. If you have a question about whether the award is taxable, you should consult your tax advisor."
724,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXSAVER,"The legal expense that you incur in the process of getting a damage award may be claimed as an itemized deduction (subject to the 2%-of-AGI floor) only if the award is included in your gross income. The same holds true for the deduction in calculating your adjusted gross income for legal fees for “civil rights” type cases created under a 2004 tax act. A “civil rights” type case is one involving claims of discrimination of any sort. If the award is only partially included in your gross income, you may deduct only a proportional amount in legal fees. Thus, if the entire award is excluded from your gross income, none of your legal fees are deductible."
725,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXSAVER,"A technique now being used in large personal injury cases is the structured settlement, in which the defendant's insurance company offers an annuity to the injured party instead of a lump-sum distribution. The IRS has ruled that the entire amount of the annuity payments may be excluded from the recipient's gross income, even though the recipient is, in effect, receiving interest."
726,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Credit card insurance. In most cases, if you receive benefits under a credit card disability or unemployment insurance plan, the benefits are taxable to you. These plans make the minimum monthly payment on your credit card account if you cannot make the payment due to injury, illness, disability, or unemployment. Report on Form 1040, line 21, the amount of benefits you received during the year that is more than the amount of the premiums you paid during the year. Down payment assistance. If you purchase a home and receive assistance from a nonprofit corporation to make the down payment, that assistance is not included in your income. If the corporation qualifies as a tax-exempt charitable organization, the assistance is treated as a gift and is included in your basis of the house. If the corporation does not qualify, the assistance is treated as a rebate or reduction of the purchase price and is not included in your basis. Employment agency fees. If you get a job through an employment agency, and the fee is paid by your employer, the fee is not includible in your income if you are not liable for it. However, if you pay it and your employer reimburses you for it, it is includible in your income. Energy conservation subsidies. You can exclude from gross income any subsidy provided, either directly or indirectly, by public utilities for the purchase or installation of an energy conservation measure for a dwelling unit. Energy conservation measure. This includes installations or modifications that are primarily designed to reduce consumption of electricity or natural gas, or improve the management of energy demand. Dwelling unit. This includes a house, apartment, condominium, mobile home, boat, or similar property. If a building or structure contains both dwelling and other units, any subsidy must be properly allocated. Estate and trust income. An estate or trust, unlike a partnership, may have to pay federal income tax. If you are a beneficiary of an estate or trust, you may be taxed on your share of its income distributed or required to be distributed to you. However, there is never a double tax. Estates and trusts file their returns on Form 1041, U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts, and your share of the income is reported to you on Schedule K-1 (Form 1041)."
727,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Generally speaking, there are three types of trusts: (1) a trust that is required to distribute all the income it earns during the year (simple trust), (2) a trust that has the choice of whether to distribute all, part, or none of the income (complex trust), and (3) a trust where the person creating the trust is treated as the owner of the trust's assets (grantor trust). The taxability of these trusts varies. A beneficiary of a simple trust must report all the income (though generally not capital gains), whether actually distributed or not, on his or her income tax return (Form 1040). A beneficiary of a complex trust will only report the income of the trust to the extent of distributions actually made by the trust to the beneficiary. The grantor of a grantor trust must report all income, gains, and deductions on his or her individual income tax return, as they are not taxed on the grantor trust return."
728,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Current income required to be distributed. If you are the beneficiary of an estate or trust that must distribute all of its current income, you must report your share of the distributable net income, whether or not you actually received it."
729,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXAMPLE,"A beneficiary of a trust that is required to distribute all of its current income receives a Schedule K-1 reporting $100 of interest income. However, the beneficiary has not received any distributions from the trust. The beneficiary must report the $100 of interest income on Schedule B of Form 1040 even though the beneficiary has not received any distributions."
730,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Current income not required to be distributed. If you are the beneficiary of an estate or trust and the fiduciary has the choice of whether to distribute all or part of the current income, you must report: §  All income that is required to be distributed to you, whether or not it is actually distributed, plus §  All other amounts actually paid or credited to you, up to the amount of your share of distributable net income."
731,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"When an estate earns income before the assets have all been distributed, it is taxed like a complex trust. Many people find this area of estate taxation very confusing, and for good reason. Gifts and inheritances are not gross income to the recipient. However, money or property that you inherit may earn some interest, dividends, or rent while the estate is being settled. It is that income that must be reported either by you or by the estate. Ordinarily, the executor of the estate files an income tax return for the estate, reporting the income, but he or she may shift the tax burden of that income to the beneficiaries if the property has already been distributed to them. See chapter 44, Decedents: Dealing with the death of a family member, for more detail."
732,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXALERT,"In some instances, adjustments for the alternative minimum tax could flow through a trust to the beneficiary. See chapter 31, How to figure your tax, for more detail."
733,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"The Affordable Care Act imposes a 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) on unearned income of individuals effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012. This 3.8% tax also applies to estates and trusts on the lesser of: (1) undistributed net investment income or (2) the excess of adjusted gross income (AGI) over $12,300. If the trust or estate has net investment income that can be carried out to the beneficiary, trustees of discretionary trusts and estates may wish to consider an individual beneficiary's threshold for triggering the NIIT since the modified AGI threshold levels at which liability for the NIIT arises for individuals are much higher; i.e., over $200,000 ($250,000 if married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er) with dependent child; $125,000 if married filing separately). There are many other considerations for the trustee to evaluate in determining how much to distribute to beneficiaries. We suggest that you and your trustee should consult with tax advisors who specialize in these matters."
734,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"How to report. Treat each item of income the same way that the estate or trust would treat it. For example, if a trust's dividend income is distributed to you, you report the distribution as dividend income on your return. The same rule applies to distributions of tax-exempt interest and capital gains. The fiduciary of the estate or trust must tell you the type of items making up your share of the estate or trust income and any credits you are allowed on your individual income tax return. Losses. Losses of estates and trusts generally are not deductible by the beneficiaries."
735,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXCEPTION,"There are significant exceptions to the rule that losses of estates and trusts are not deductible by the beneficiaries. When an estate or a trust terminates, the beneficiaries are frequently allowed a deduction for certain expenses that the estate or trust had but was unable to use as a deduction. These items are (1) net operating loss carryovers, (2) certain excess deductions in the year of termination, and (3) capital loss carryovers. When an estate is terminated, it is not unusual for the attorney's and executor's fees to be paid in the year in which the estate is closed. If these expenses and any net operating loss carried over exceed the estate's income for that year, the excess is deductible by the beneficiaries. This deduction may be claimed only by itemizing deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). These deductions are subject to the 2% rule on miscellaneous itemized deductions. This means that they are only deductible to the extent that total miscellaneous itemized deductions exceed 2% of AGI. A capital loss carryover from an estate or a trust may be used in the beneficiaries’ current or subsequent returns to reduce capital gains and/or to generate a deduction subject to the limitation that only $3,000 ($1,500 if your filing status is married filing separately) of capital losses in excess of capital gains may be deducted each year. When to report estate and trust income. You must include your share of the estate or trust income on your return for your tax year in which the last day of the estate or trust tax year falls. The trustee of the trust or estate will provide you with a Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) that tells you each item of income and deductions, and where they are to be reported on your personal tax return."
736,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXSAVER,"It may be a good idea if you are the beneficiary of a trust to inform the trustee of your tax situation so that all possible tax-saving alternatives can be explored. Amounts that are not required to be distributed currently, according to the terms of the trust, may sometimes be distributed at the discretion of the trustee. There may be substantial tax planning opportunities relating to the timing, amounts, and methods of such distributions. You and the trustee should consult with a tax professional specializing in this area."
737,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"If you are receiving trust income, you should consider whether it is necessary for you to make estimated tax payments or increase your withholding taxes as a result of this additional income. See chapter 4, Tax withholding and estimated tax."
738,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Grantor trust. Income earned by a grantor trust is taxable to the grantor, not the beneficiary, if the grantor keeps certain control over the trust. (The grantor is the one who transferred property to the trust.) This rule applies if the property (or income from the property) put into the trust will or may revert (be returned) to the grantor or the grantor's spouse. Generally, a trust is a grantor trust if the grantor has a reversionary interest valued (at the date of transfer) at more than 5% of the value of the transferred property."
739,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXALERT,"Even though the grantor is taxed on the trust income, the trustee of a grantor trust may need to file Form 1041 if the trust income reaches a level that requires a return or if a separate federal identification number has been established by the trust. The items of income, deduction, and credit are treated as owned by the grantor or another person, and are reported on a separate statement (Tax Information Letter) that is attached to Form 1041. The IRS issued regulations that provide guidance for optional methods of reporting trust income by a grantor trust. For example, alternative methods of reporting include the issuance of a Form 1099 directly from the payer of income to the grantor for inclusion on the grantor's individual income tax return; the issuance of a Form 1099 by the trust to the grantor; or the filing of a Form 1041 by the trustee of the grantor trust. The rules can get complicated, especially if there is more than one grantor. You should consult with your tax advisor for more information."
740,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Expenses paid by another. If your personal expenses are paid for by another person, such as a corporation, the payment may be taxable to you depending upon your relationship with that person and the nature of the payment. But if the payment makes up for a loss caused by that person, and only restores you to the position you were in before the loss, the payment is not includible in your income. Fees for services. Include all fees for your services in your income. Examples of these fees are amounts you receive for services you perform as: §  A corporate director, §  An executor, administrator, or personal representative of an estate, §  A manager of a trade or business you operated before declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy, §  A notary public, or §  An election precinct official. Nonemployee compensation. If you are not an employee and the fees for your services from a single payer in the course of the payer's trade or business total $600 or more for the year, the payer should send you a Form 1099-MISC. You may need to report your fees as self-employment income. See Self-Employed Persons, in chapter 1, for a discussion of when you are considered self-employed. Corporate director. Corporate director fees are self-employment income. Report these payments on Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040). Personal representatives. All personal representatives must include in their gross income fees paid to them from an estate. If you are not in the trade or business of being an executor (for instance, you are the executor of a friend's or relative's estate), report these fees on Form 1040, line 21. If you are in the trade or business of being an executor, report these fees as self-employment income on Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040). The fee is not includible in income if it is waived. Manager of trade or business for bankruptcy estate. Include in your income all payments received from your bankruptcy estate for managing or operating a trade or business that you operated before you filed for bankruptcy. Report this income on Form 1040, line 21. Notary public. Report payments for these services on Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040). These payments are not subject to self-employment tax. See the separate instructions for Schedule SE (Form 1040) for details. Election precinct official. You should receive a Form W-2 showing payments for services performed as an election official or election worker. Report these payments on line 7 of Form 1040 or Form 1040A or on line 1 of Form 1040EZ."
741,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Self-employment income. Chapter 39, Self-employment income: How to file Schedule C, includes a more comprehensive discussion of self-employment income. Corporate director fees and executor fees (if you are in the trade or business of being an executor) are considered self-employment income, and are subject to self-employment tax. For both employees and self-employed individuals, the 2016 wage base is $118,500 social security (old age, survivor, and disability insurance (OASDI)) and is unlimited for Medicare. The OASDI rate is 12.4% The Medicare tax rate is 2.9%. However, under the Affordable Care Act, beginning in 2013, an Additional Medicare Tax of 0.9% is assessed on top of the current 2.9% rate—for a total rate of 3.8%—on self-employment income (as well as wages) received in excess of specified threshold amounts ($250,000 for a joint return; $125,000 for a married individual filing a separate return; and $200,000 for all other taxpayers. (For joint filers, the additional 0.9% tax applies to the couple's combined wages in excess of $250,000.) The combined 12.4% OASDI, 2.9% Medicare, and, if applicable, 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax rates are applied to 92.35% of your self-employment income. However, if your net earnings from self-employment are less than $400, no self-employment tax is payable. Thus, for example, if a person on earns self-employment income of $130,000 in 2016, he or she will pay self- employment tax of $18,176—i.e., ($118,500 × 15.3%) plus [($130,000 × 92.35%) − $118,500) × 2.9%. For a single filer who has self-employment income of $230,000 in 2016, he or she will pay self-employment tax of $20,966—i.e., ($118,500 × 15.3%) plus [($230,000 × 92.35%) − $118,500) × 2.9% plus [($230,000 × 92.35%) − $200,000) × 0.9%. See Schedule SE, Self-Employment Tax, and Form 8959, Additional Medicare Tax. Fees are self-employment income only if you present yourself as being in the trade or business that produces the fees. Therefore, unless you regularly appear as a witness, act as an executor or trustee, or judge elections, the fees earned will not be self-employment income subject to self-employment tax. Clergy fees. Fees received by clergy for performing funerals, marriages, baptisms, or other services must be included in gross income."
742,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXSAVER,"A member of the clergy, however, can request to be exempt from the self-employment tax on such income by filing Form 4361, Application for Exemption from Self-Employment Tax for Use by Ministers, Members of Religious Orders, and Christian Science Practitioners."
743,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Any business that pays you $600 or more in fees should provide you with a Form 1099. A copy of this form should also be filed with the IRS by the business. Individual payers are not required to file this form. However, you are not excused from your responsibility to report the income just because you do not receive a Form 1099. Professional fees. Fees received by a doctor, lawyer, and other professionals should be shown on Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business, not in the Miscellaneous Income section on line 21 of Form 1040. Otherwise, the IRS's document-matching program may generate unwarranted notices, suggesting that you have underpaid your tax. Sole proprietorship (self-employment) income. Unlike a partnership or a regular corporation, a sole proprietorship is not a separate entity. In a sole proprietorship, you and your business are one and the same. You report gross profit or loss for the year from the sole proprietorship on Form 1040, Schedule C (or Schedule C-EZ if you meet certain requirements), and it becomes part of your AGI. In addition to owing income tax on such income, you, as the sole proprietor, will usually be liable for self-employment tax. See chapter 39, Self-employment income: How to file Schedule C, for a more comprehensive discussion. You may also be required to make payments of estimated taxes. A net loss from the business can generally be deducted in computing your AGI. Your profit (or loss) is computed as income less your allowable deductions. Income includes cash, property, and services received by the business from all sources, unless specifically excluded under the tax code. Allowable deductions include all necessary and ordinary expenses incurred in connection with the business. For sole proprietorships in the business of selling goods or inventory, the primary expense will be the cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold represents the cost of materials, labor, and overhead included in the inventory sold during the year. Other expenses that you deduct on Schedule C include salaries and wages, interest on loans used in the business, rent, depreciation, bad debts, travel and entertainment, insurance, real estate taxes, and so on. If you operate your own business or have other self-employment income, such as babysitting or selling crafts, see these other publications for more information."

746,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Foster care providers. Generally, payment you receive from a state, political subdivision, or a qualified foster care placement agency for caring for a qualified foster individual in your home is excluded from your income. However, you must include in your income payment to the extent it is received for the care of more than 5 qualified foster individuals age 19 years or older. A qualified foster individual is a person who: 1.    Is living in a foster family home, and 2.    Was placed there by: a.       An agency of a state or one of its political subdivisions, or b.      A qualified foster care placement agency."
747,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"You may be able to claim a foster child as a dependent and receive an additional exemption deduction of up to $4,050 for 2016. See chapter 3, Personal exemptions and dependents, for the rules that apply to determine whether or not your foster child meets the definition of a qualifying child or qualifying relative who can be claimed as a dependent."
748,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Difficulty-of-care payments. These are payments that are designated by the payer as compensation for providing the additional care that is required for physically, mentally, or emotionally handicapped qualified foster individuals. A state must determine that this compensation is needed, and the care for which the payments are made must be provided in the foster care provider's home in which the qualified foster individual was placed. Certain Medicaid waiver payments are treated as difficulty-of-care payments when received by an individual care provider for caring for an eligible individual (whether related or unrelated) living in the provider's home. See Notice 2014-7 available at www.irs.gov/irb/2014-4_IRB/ar06.html and related questions and answers available at www.irs.gov/Individuals/Certain-Medicaid-Waiver-Payments-May-Be-Excludable-From-Income for more information. You must include in your income difficulty-of-care payments to the extent they are received for more than: §  10 qualified foster individuals under age 19, or §  qualified foster individuals age 19 or older. Maintaining space in home. If you are paid to maintain space in your home for emergency foster care, you must include the payment in your income. Reporting taxable payments. If you receive payments that you must include in your income and you are in business as a foster care provider, report the payments on Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040). See Publication 587, Business Use of Your Home, to help you determine the amount you can deduct for the use of your home. Found property. If you find and keep property that does not belong to you that has been lost or abandoned (treasure-trove), it is taxable to you at its fair market value in the first year it is your undisputed possession. Free tour. If you received a free tour from a travel agency for organizing a group of tourists, you must include its value in your income. Report the fair market value of the tour on Form 1040, line 21, if you are not in the trade or business of organizing tours. You cannot deduct your expenses in serving as the voluntary leader of the group at the group's request. If you organize tours as a trade or business, report the tour's value on Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040). Gambling winnings. You must include your gambling winnings in income on Form 1040, line 21. If you itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040), you can deduct gambling losses you had during the year, but only up to the amount of your winnings. If you are in the trade or business of gambling, use Schedule C. Lotteries and raffles. Winnings from lotteries and raffles are gambling winnings. In addition to cash winnings, you must include in your income the fair market value of bonds, cars, houses, and other noncash prizes."
749,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"If you win a large lottery, proper financial planning can help you minimize the tax bite. You should consult with a financial planner and/or your tax advisor."

751,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Form W-2G. You may have received a Form W-2G, Certain Gambling Winnings, showing the amount of your gambling winnings and any tax taken out of them. Include the amount from box 1 on Form 1040, line 21. Include the amount shown in box 4 on Form 1040, line 64, as federal income tax withheld. Reporting winnings and recordkeeping. For more information on reporting gambling winnings and recordkeeping, see Gambling Losses Up to the Amount of Gambling Winnings in chapter 29."
752,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"While a winner of the Canadian government lottery does not have to pay Canadian tax on the winnings, a U.S. citizen or resident who wins does have to pay U.S. tax on the amount. Citizens and residents of the United   States have to report all income, including foreign income. See chapter 42, U.S. citizens working abroad: Tax treatment of foreign earned income, and chapter 43, Foreign citizens living in the United States, for more information about worldwide income."
753,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"Because you may not win money gambling until late in the year and gambling losses are deductible only up to the amount of your winnings, you should plan ahead by keeping losing racetrack, lottery, and other gambling tickets. In that way, if you do win, you will be able to itemize your gambling losses. It's also a good idea to keep a diary of gambling losses incurred during the entire year. Note that losses from one kind of gambling are deductible against gains from another kind. These losses are claimed as miscellaneous itemized deductions but are not subject to the 2%-of-AGI floor and are reported on Schedule A, line 28. These losses are also allowed for purposes of the alternative minimum tax (AMT)."
754,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Gifts and inheritances. In most cases, property you receive as a gift, bequest, or inheritance is not included in your income. However, if property you receive this way later produces income such as interest, dividends, or rents, that income is taxable to you. If property is given to a trust and the income from it is paid, credited, or distributed to you, that income is also taxable to you. If the gift, bequest, or inheritance is the income from the property, that income is taxable to you."
755,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Items given to you as an incentive to enter into a business transaction are not tax-free gifts. For example, incentive items such as small appliances or dinnerware given to you by a bank as an incentive to open an account are treated as taxable interest income to you and must be reported at their fair market value."
756,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Inherited pension or IRA. If you inherited a pension or an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), you may have to include part of the inherited amount in your income. See Survivors and Beneficiaries in Publication 575, if you inherited a pension. See What if You Inherit an IRA? in Publications 590-A and 590-B, if you inherited an IRA."
757,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXALERT,"Distributions from qualified retirement plans and IRAs are not subject to the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) that is imposed by the Affordable Care Act. On the other hand, these distributions are taken into account in determining a taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income threshold for purposes of figuring the amount subject to the 3.8% NIIT."
758,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Hobby losses. Losses from a hobby are not deductible from other income. A hobby is an activity from which you do not expect to make a profit. See Activity not for profit, earlier."
759,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"While a net loss from the sale of stamps, coins, or other items that you collect for a hobby may not be deducted, a loss from the sale of these items may be offset against a gain from the sale of similar items occurring in the same year. Example You sell several stamps at a gain of $1,000. You may offset this gain by up to $1,000 in losses from the sale of other stamps. The result is that there is no net taxable gain to report on your income tax return. Each sale should be listed separately on Form 8949 and reported on Schedule D."
760,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXSAVER,"If you are planning to sell an item in your collection that has appreciated in value and your collection also contains an item that has decreased in value, you may want to sell both in the same year to incur the least amount of tax. In short, clean out the junk to establish losses in a year when you have gains."
761,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,Tip,"If you collect stamps, coins, or other items as a hobby for recreation and pleasure, and you sell any of the items, your gain is taxable as a capital gain. (See chapter 16.) However, if you sell items from your collection at a loss, you cannot deduct the loss."
762,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Illegal activities. Income from illegal activities, such as money from dealing illegal drugs, must be included in your income on Form 1040, line 21, or on Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040) if from your self-employment activity."
763,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"It is not necessary for the activity that produces income to be legal for the income to be taxable. Income from illegal activities, such as embezzlement, drug dealing, bookmaking, and bootlegging, is taxable. Al Capone, the notorious Chicago bootlegger during Prohibition, was convicted of income tax evasion because he did not report his illegal income. Embezzlement income is taxable in the year in which the funds are stolen. If the embezzler pays back the stolen funds in a later year, he or she can claim a deduction in the year of repayment."
764,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Indian fishing rights. If you are a member of a qualified Indian tribe that has fishing rights secured by treaty, executive order, or an Act of Congress as of March 17, 1988, do not include in your income amounts you receive from activities related to those fishing rights. The income is not subject to income tax, self-employment tax, or employment taxes."
765,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXALERT,"Investment clubs. An investment club is a group of friends, neighbors, business associates, or others who pool limited or stated amounts of funds to invest in stock or other securities. The club may or may not have a written agreement, charter, or bylaws. Usually, the group operates informally with members pledging a regular amount to be paid into the club monthly. Some clubs have a committee that gathers information on securities, selects the most promising, and recommends that the club invest in them. Other clubs rotate the investigatory responsibilities among all their members. Most require all members to vote for or against all investments, sales, exchanges, or other transactions. How the income from an investment club is reported on your tax return depends on how the club operates. Most clubs operate as partnerships and are treated as such for federal tax purposes. Others operate as corporations, trusts, or associations taxed as corporations. Members of an investment club organized as a partnership should include their share of each type of the club's income on their returns. For example, dividends are reported on Schedule B, Interest and Ordinary Dividends, Part II, line 5, and capital gains are reported on Form 8949, Sales and Dispositions of Capital Assets, and Schedule D, Capital Gains and Losses. The expenses incurred by the club to produce or to collect income, to manage investment property, or to determine any tax due are also reported separately. You may deduct your share of these items on Schedule A, Itemized Deductions, as a miscellaneous deduction if you itemize your deductions. Note: These expenses—along with some others—must exceed 2% of your AGI to be deductible as miscellaneous itemized deductions. Depending on how your investment club is organized, it may be required to file a separate partnership, corporation, or trust tax return. More details are explained in IRS Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses, some of which follow. Tax returns and identifying numbers. Investment clubs must file either Form 1065, U.S. Partnership Return of Income; Form 1041, U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts; or Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return. Certain small corporations may be able to file Form 1120-A, U.S. Corporation Short-Form Income Tax Return. See the instructions for Forms 1120 and 1120-A. Form SS-4. Each club must have an employer identification number (EIN) to use when filing its return. The club's EIN also may have to be given to the payer of dividends. If your club does not have an EIN, use Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number. File the completed Form SS-4 with the IRS according to the Form SS-4 instructions. Alternatively, the IRS also provides an online EIN application process which instantly assigns an EIN. Both Form SS-4 and the online application can be found on the IRS website at www.irs.gov. Stock in name of club. When stock is recorded in the name of the investment club, the club must give its own EIN to the payer of dividends. If the club is a partnership or a trust, the dividends distributed to the partners or beneficiaries must be shown on Form 1065 or Form 1041, respectively. The partners’ or the beneficiaries’ identifying numbers also must be shown on the return. If the club is an association taxed as a corporation, any distribution it makes that qualifies as a dividend must be reported on Forms 1096, Annual Summary and Transmittal of U.S. Information Returns, and 1099-DIV, Dividends and Distributions, if total distributions to the shareholder are $10 or more for the year. Stock in name of member. When stock is recorded in the name of one club member, this member must give his or her social security number to the payer of dividends. (When stock is held in the names of two or more club members, the social security number of only one member must be given to the payer.) This member is considered as the record owner for the actual owner of the stock, the investment club. This member is a “nominee” and must file Form 1099-DIV showing the club to be the owner of the dividend, his or her social security number, and the EIN of the club. Example In order to avoid any matching notices from the IRS, the nominee should report the dividend income on his or her tax return on line 5, Part II, of Form 1040, Schedule B and then subtract out the nominee distribution."
766,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"ABC company $100 Less: Nominee distribution ($100) No social security coverage for investment club earnings. If an investment club partnership's activities are limited to investing in savings certificates, stock, or securities and collecting interest or dividends for its members’ accounts, the members’ share of income is not earnings from self-employment. You cannot voluntarily pay the self-employment tax in order to increase your social security coverage and ultimate benefits. For more information about investment clubs, see Publication 550."
767,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Interest on frozen deposits. In general, you exclude from your income the amount of interest earned on a frozen deposit. See Interest income on frozen deposits in chapter 7. Interest on qualified savings bonds. You may be able to exclude from income the interest from qualified U.S. savings bonds you redeem if you pay qualified higher educational expenses in the same year. For more information on this exclusion, see Education Savings Bond Program under U.S. Savings Bonds in chapter 7. Job interview expenses. If a prospective employer asks you to appear for an interview and either pays you an allowance or reimburses you for your transportation and other travel expenses, the amount you receive is generally not taxable. You include in income only the amount you receive that is more than your actual expenses. Jury duty. Jury duty pay you receive must be included in your income on Form 1040, line 21. If you gave any of your jury duty pay to your employer because your employer continued to pay you while you served jury duty, include the amount you gave your employer as an income adjustment on Form 1040, line 36, and see the instructions there."
768,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Jury fees. This item is often overlooked. Just because a fee is paid by a government body does not mean that it is not subject to tax. However, the Tax Court has ruled that the mileage allowance received by a juror to cover the cost of transportation between the court and his or her home is not included in income. In addition, if you are required to give your jury pay to your employer, you can claim a deduction for the amount paid over. You can claim this deduction whether or not you itemize your deductions. You would report the income on line 21 of Form 1040 and, if you give your jury pay to your employer, report it as an adjustment on line 36 and write “Jury Pay” next to the amount."
769,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Kickbacks. You must include kickbacks, side commissions, push money, or similar payments you receive in your income on Form 1040, line 21, or on Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040), if from your self-employment activity. Example. You sell cars and help arrange car insurance for buyers. Insurance brokers pay back part of their commissions to you for referring customers to them. You must include the kickbacks in your income. Medical savings accounts (MSAs). In most cases, you do not include in income amounts you withdraw from your Archer MSA or Medicare Advantage MSA if you use the money to pay for qualified medical expenses. Generally, qualified medical expenses are those you can deduct on Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions. For more information about qualified medical expenses, see chapter 22. For more information about Archer MSAs or Medicare Advantage MSAs, see Publication 969, Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans."
770,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXSAVER,"Contributions to an MSA or HSA can also be deductible. See chapter 22, Medical and dental expenses, for details."
771,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Prizes and awards. If you win a prize in a lucky number drawing, television or radio quiz program, beauty contest, or other event, you must include it in your income. For example, if you win a $50 prize in a photography contest, you must report this income on Form 1040, line 21. If you refuse to accept a prize, do not include its value in your income."
772,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"An individual wins a prize in a charitable fund-raising raffle and refuses to accept the prize, returning the prize to the charity. The individual need not include the value of the prize as income on his or her return. Likewise, the individual is not entitled to a charitable deduction."
773,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,Prizes and awards in goods or services must be included in your income at their fair market value.
774,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"Fair market value is the price at which property would be exchanged between a willing buyer and a willing seller when neither party is compelled to buy or to sell. When merchandise is received as a prize, fair market value is the suggested retail price, unless some other measure of fair market value can be readily ascertained. Other ways to measure fair market value that have been approved by the courts include the following: 1.  Resale value The Tax Court has ruled that, in some cases, the fair market value of an item is what you could realize by selling it. 2.  Value to the recipient If you receive a prize that is not something you would ordinarily purchase, the Tax Court has said that you may discount the value of the prize. Example 1 An individual received a new car as an award from her employer. The Tax Court ruled that the amount to be considered as income was not what the employer had paid for the car but how much the recipient would have realized by selling the car immediately after it was received. Example 2 Taxpayers received two first-class cruise tickets from a game show. The tickets were nontransferable and had to be used within 1 year. The Tax Court found that the tickets were not something that the taxpayers would normally have acquired but were a luxury that would otherwise have been beyond their means. Accordingly, the Tax Court permitted the taxpayers to include an amount less than the retail price of the tickets in their gross income. There is no standardized technique to determine the amount to be included in gross income in cases similar to these. Our advice is this: If you believe that you can justify a value less than normal retail price, it may be worthwhile to include the lower amount in gross income."
775,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Employee awards or bonuses. Cash awards or bonuses given to you by your employer for good work or suggestions generally must be included in your income as wages. However, certain noncash employee achievement awards can be excluded from income. See Bonuses and awards in chapter 5."
776,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXSAVER,"Note received for services. If your employer gives you a negotiable note as payment for your services, you must include the fair market value (usually the discounted value) of the note in your income as wages for the year you receive it. When you later receive payments on the note, part of each payment is a recovery of the fair market value that you previously included in your income. Do not include that part in your income again. Include the rest of the payment in your income in the year of payment. The fair market value of a note is extremely difficult to determine, unless the note may be sold to a third party, and even then its worth may be difficult to determine. If the issuer of the note is insolvent, the fair market value of the note may be zero. In this case, any money you subsequently get from the issuer is taxed as ordinary income in the year in which you receive it. Similarly, if the value of the note is less than its face value, any amount that you subsequently receive from the issuer that is greater than the recognized value of the note is taxed as ordinary income in the year in which it is received. A note's fair market value may be less than its face amount if, based on the facts and circumstances at the time the note is issued, it is uncertain that you will be able to collect the face amount. A note may also be considered to be worth less than its face amount if the interest rate that it pays is below the market rate or the collateral pledged against the note is limited. If you think the note you receive may be worth more or less than its face value, consult your tax advisor about how to report the transaction."
777,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Pulitzer, Nobel, and similar prizes. If you were awarded a prize in recognition of accomplishments in religious, charitable, scientific, artistic, educational, literary, or civic fields, you generally must include the value of the prize in your income. However, you do not include this prize in your income if you meet all of the following requirements. §  You were selected without any action on your part to enter the contest or proceeding. §  You are not required to perform substantial future services as a condition to receiving the prize or award. §  The prize or award is transferred by the payer directly to a governmental unit or tax-exempt charitable organization as designated by you. See Publication 525 for more information about the conditions that apply to the transfer. Qualified tuition programs (QTPs). A qualified tuition program (also known as a 529 program) is a program set up to allow you to either prepay or contribute to an account established for paying a student's qualified higher education expenses at an eligible educational institution. A program can be established and maintained by a state, an agency or instrumentality of a state, or an eligible educational institution. The part of a distribution representing the amount paid or contributed to a QTP is not included in income. This is a return of the investment in the program. In most cases, the beneficiary does not include in income any earnings distributed from a QTP if the total distribution is less than or equal to adjusted qualified higher education expenses. See Publication 970 for more information."
778,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,EXPLANATION,"See chapter 36, Education credits and other education tax benefits, for further information on qualified tuition programs (QTPs) and qualified education expenses."
779,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,TaxCode,TAXCODE,"Railroad retirement annuities. The following types of payments are treated as pension or annuity income and are taxable under the rules explained in Publication 575, Pension and Annuity Income. §  Tier 1 railroad retirement benefits that are more than the social security equivalent benefit. §  Tier 2 benefits. §  Vested dual benefits. Rewards. If you receive a reward for providing information, include it in your income. Sale of home. You may be able to exclude from income all or part of any gain from the sale or exchange of your main home. See chapter 15. Sale of personal items. If you sold an item you owned for personal use, such as a car, refrigerator, furniture, stereo, jewelry, or silverware, your gain is taxable as a capital gain. Report it as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). You cannot deduct a loss. However, if you sold an item you held for investment, such as gold or silver bullion, coins, or gems, any gain is taxable as a capital gain and any loss is deductible as a capital loss. Example. You sold a painting on an online auction website for $100. You bought the painting for $20 at a garage sale years ago. Report your gain as a capital gain as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). Scholarships and fellowships. A candidate for a degree can exclude amounts received as a qualified scholarship or fellowship. A qualified scholarship or fellowship is any amount you receive that is for: §  Tuition and fees to enroll at or attend an educational institution, or §  Fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for courses at the educational institution. Amounts used for room and board do not qualify for the exclusion. See Publication 970 for more information on qualified scholarships and fellowship grants. Payment for services. In most cases, you must include in income the part of any scholarship or fellowship that represents payment for past, present, or future teaching, research, or other services. This applies even if all candidates for a degree must perform the services to receive the degree. For information about the rules that apply to a tax-free qualified tuition reduction provided to employees and their families by an educational institution, see Publication 970. VA payments. Allowances paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs are not included in your income. These allowances are not considered scholarship or fellowship grants. Prizes. Scholarship prizes won in a contest are not scholarships or fellowships if you do not have to use the prizes for educational purposes. You must include these amounts in your income on Form 1040, line 21, whether or not you use the amounts for educational purposes. Stolen property. If you steal property, you must report its fair market value in your income in the year you steal it unless in the same year, you return it to its rightful owner. Transporting school children. Do not include in your income a school board mileage allowance for taking children to and from school if you are not in the business of taking children to school. You cannot deduct expenses for providing this transportation. Union benefits and dues. Amounts deducted from your pay for union dues, assessments, contributions, or other payments to a union cannot be excluded from your income. You may be able to deduct some of these payments as a miscellaneous deduction subject to the 2%-of-AGI limit if they are related to your job and if you itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). For more information, see Union Dues and Expenses in chapter 29. Strike and lockout benefits. Benefits paid to you by a union as strike or lockout benefits, including both cash and the fair market value of other property, are usually included in your income as compensation. You can exclude these benefits from your income only when the facts clearly show that the union intended them as gifts to you. Utility rebates. If you are a customer of an electric utility company and you participate in the utility's energy conservation program, you may receive on your monthly electric bill either: §  A reduction in the purchase price of electricity furnished to you (rate reduction), or §  A nonrefundable credit against the purchase price of the electricity. The amount of the rate reduction or nonrefundable credit is not included in your income."
780,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,Passive Activity Limitations and At-Risk Limitations,"Explanation Individuals, estates, trusts, closely held corporations, and personal service corporations are generally prohibited from deducting net losses generated by passive activities. In addition, tax credits from passive activities are generally limited to the tax liability attributable to those activities. Disallowed passive activity losses are suspended and carried forward indefinitely to offset passive activity income generated in future years. Similar carryforward treatment applies to suspended credits. Note that these rules relate to passive income/losses and do not apply to portfolio income/losses. Portfolio income/losses include interest, dividends, annuities, and royalties, as well as gain or loss from the disposition of income-producing or investment property that is not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business."
781,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXALERT,"Defining passive activities. A passive activity involves the conduct of any trade or business in which you do not materially participate. You are treated as a material participant only if you are involved in the operations of the activity on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis. If you are not a material participant in an activity but your spouse is, you are treated as being a material participant and the activity is not considered passive. Seven tests. The IRS has seven tests you can meet to be considered a material participant. If you satisfy one of these tests, you will be considered a material participant in any activity. These tests are: 1.  You participate more than 500 hours per taxable year. 2.  Your participation during the taxable year constitutes substantially all of the participation of all individuals involved. 3.  You participate for more than 100 hours during the taxable year and no one else participates more than you participated. 4.  The activity is a significant participation activity (SPA) for the taxable year, and your participation in all SPAs during the taxable year exceeds 500 hours. An SPA is an activity in which an individual participates for more than 100 hours but does not otherwise meet a material participation test. 5.  You materially participated in any 5 of the 10 preceding taxable years. 6.  The activity is a personal service activity, and you materially participated for any 3 preceding taxable years. A personal service activity involves performance of personal services in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial sciences, performing arts, consulting, or any other business in which capital is not a material income-producing factor. 7.  Based on all the facts and circumstances, your participation is regular, continuous, and substantial during the taxable year. Defining an activity. The proper grouping of business operations into one or more activities is important in determining the allocation of suspended losses, measuring material participation, separating rental and nonrental activities, and determining when a disposition of an activity has occurred. IRS regulations define an activity as any “appropriate economic unit for measuring gain or loss.” What constitutes an “appropriate economic unit” is determined by looking at all facts and circumstances. The regulations list five factors that are to be given the greatest weight. They are: 1.    Similarities and differences in types of business 2.    The extent of common control 3.    The extent of common ownership 4.    Geographical location 5.    Interdependence between the activities Generally, taxpayers must be consistent from year to year in determining the business operations that constitute an activity. Consult your tax advisor for more information."
782,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"“At-Risk” Limitation Provisions The deduction for business losses is generally limited to the amount by which you are considered to be “at-risk” in the activity. You are considered at risk for the amount of cash you have invested in the venture and the basis of property invested plus certain amounts borrowed for use in the activity. Borrowed amounts that are considered at risk are (1) loans for which you are personally liable for repayment or (2) loans secured by property, other than that used in the activity. Generally, liabilities that are secured by property within the activity for which you are not otherwise personally liable are not considered to be at risk. An exception: If nonrecourse financing—financing for which you are not personally liable—is secured against real property used in the activity, you may be considered at risk for the amount of financing. The law provides a broad list of activities (including the holding of real estate acquired after 1986) that are subject to the “at-risk” provisions. If the “at-risk” provisions apply to you, you should consult with your tax advisor. Passive Activity Losses The passive activity rules limit losses and credits from passive trade or business activities. Deductions attributable to passive activities, to the extent they exceed income from passive activities, generally may not be deducted against other income, such as wages, portfolio income, or business income that is not derived from a passive activity. Losses that are suspended under these rules are carried forward indefinitely and are treated as losses from passive activities in succeeding years. Suspended losses from a particular activity are allowed in full when a taxpayer disposes of his or her entire interest in that particular passive activity to an unrelated person. For dispositions made after January 1, 1995, you must dispose of “substantially all” of a passive activity in order to deduct that same portion. You may also be able to deduct suspended losses in a passive activity if your interest is disposed of in other ways, including abandonment and death of the taxpayer. See Disposition of Passive Activity, discussed later. Special rules may apply; you should consult your tax advisor. Rental Real Estate As previously discussed, generally, a trade or business activity is passive unless the taxpayer materially participates in that activity. Rental real estate activities, however, are passive regardless of the level of the taxpayer's participation. A special rule permits the deduction of up to $25,000 of losses from certain rental real estate activities (even though they are considered passive) if the taxpayer actively participates in them. This special rule is available in full to taxpayers with a modified AGI of $100,000 or less and phases out for taxpayers with a modified AGI between $100,000 and $150,000. For further information about rental real estate passive rules, see chapter 9, Rental income and expenses. Real Estate Professionals Passive activity limitations for certain real estate professionals are more liberal than they used to be. Taxpayers who satisfy certain eligibility thresholds and materially participate in rental real estate activities may treat any losses as losses from a nonpassive activity and may use these losses against all sources of taxable income. Eligibility. Only individuals and closely held C corporations can qualify for this special rule. An individual taxpayer will qualify for any tax year if more than one-half of the personal services (with more than 750 hours) performed in trades or businesses by the taxpayer during such a tax year are performed in real property trades or businesses in which the taxpayer materially participates. A real property trade or business includes any real property development, redevelopment, construction, reconstruction, acquisition, conversion, rental, operation, management, leasing, or brokerage trade or business. Personal services performed as an employee are not considered in determining material participation unless the employee has more than a 5% ownership in the business during any part of the tax year. However, independent contractor realtor services would qualify for this purpose. For closely held C corporations, the eligibility requirements are met if more than 50% of the corporation's gross receipts for the tax year are derived from real property trades or businesses in which the corporation materially participates. Example 1 During 2016, a self-employed real estate developer earned $100,000 in development fees from projects the developer spent 1,200 hours developing. In addition, the developer incurred rental real estate losses of $200,000 from properties that the developer spent over 800 hours managing during 2016. The developer performs no other personal services during the year and has no other items of income or deduction. Because the developer (1) materially participated in the rental real estate activity, (2) performed more than 750 hours in real property trades or businesses, and (3) performed more than 50% of the developer's total personal service hours in real estate trades or businesses in which the developer materially participated, the developer will have a net operating loss of $100,000 to carry back (and the excess to carry forward) to offset any source of income. This rule for real estate professionals’ passive loss relief is a two-step process. First, you must demonstrate eligibility for the relief provision by achieving the required levels of personal services in real estate trades or businesses. Thereafter, you get relief from the passive loss limitations only for your rental real estate activities for which you satisfy the material participation standards. For spouses filing joint returns, each spouse's personal services are taken into account separately. However, in determining material participation, the participation of the other spouse is taken into account as required under current law. Example 2 A husband and wife filing a joint return meet the eligibility requirements if, during the tax year, one spouse performs more than 750 hours representing at least half of his or her personal services in a real estate trade or business in which either spouse materially participates. Aggregation of Activities Whether a taxpayer materially participates in his or her rental real estate activities is determined generally as if each interest of the taxpayer in rental real estate is a separate activity. However, the taxpayer may elect to treat all interest in rental real estate as one activity. The election permitting a taxpayer to aggregate his or her rental real estate activities for testing for material participation is not intended to alter the rules with respect to material participation through limited partnership interest. Generally, no interest as a limited partner is treated as an interest with respect to which a taxpayer materially participates. However, Treasury regulations provide that a limited partner is considered to materially participate in the activities conducted through the partnership in certain situations where (1) the limited partner is also a general partner at all times during the partnership's tax year, (2) the limited partner materially participates in the activity during any 5 of the preceding 10 years, or (3) the activity is a personal service activity in which the limited partner materially participated for any 3 preceding years. Losses attributable to limited partnership interests are considered passive, except where regulations provide otherwise. In general, working interests in any oil or gas property held directly or through an entity that does not limit the taxpayer's liability are not considered passive, whether or not the taxpayer is a material participant. The IRS has issued regulations with regard to the aggregation of activities in order to satisfy the material participation tests for real estate professionals. These rules are very complex and hold potential tax traps for the unwary. We recommend that you consult with your tax advisor if you believe that electing to aggregate activities may be beneficial to you. Example 1 Three brothers own a hardware store as partners. Two of them consider it their full-time job, because it is their only source of income. The third brother lives 200 miles away and is consulted only on major issues. The two brothers who work at the store meet the material participation test. The third brother has a passive investment. Example 2 Bonnie owns a one-sixteenth interest in four different racehorses. She does not own the stables where the horses are trained and fed. She is not involved in the daily care of the horses. She pays her fair share of the costs and offers advice regarding when and where the horses are to run. Bonnie has significant salary income from a full-time job and from managing her portfolio. Bonnie is probably not a material participant. Example 3 Chris owns rental property. He has a passive investment. Exception An exception to the general rule that does not allow grouping rental activities with business activity is that, in certain instances, passive rental losses can offset income from business activities. For this exception to apply, you must hold the same proportionate ownership interest in each activity. Example Jack and Jill are married and file a joint return. Jack owns and operates a grocery store that generates net income for the current year. Jill owns the building, of which 25% is rented to Jack's grocery store activity (grocery store rental). The building rental activities generate a net loss in the current year. Because they file a joint return, Jack and Jill are treated as one taxpayer. Therefore, the sole owner of the grocery store activity is also the sole owner of the rental activity. Consequently, each owner of the business activity has the same proportionate ownership interest in the rental activity. Accordingly, both activities may be grouped together; thus, the net income from Jack's grocery store can be offset by the amount of net loss from Jill's building rental activities. See your tax advisor for more information if you think this exception applies to your situation."
783,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"The Affordable Care Act imposes a Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) on unearned income of individuals effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012. For individuals, the NIIT is 3.8% of the lesser of: (1) “Net Investment Income” or (2) the excess of modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $200,000 ($250,000 if married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er) with dependent child; $125,000 if married filing separately). Net investment income subject to the tax is defined as investment income reduced by allocable deductions. Investment income includes income from businesses that are passive activities to the taxpayer (as well as other unearned income from interest, dividends, rents, and annuities not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business, trade or business income from trading in financial instruments or commodities, and net gains from the disposition of property not used in a trade or business). On the other hand, income from an activity in which a taxpayer materially participates is not included in net investment income. The NIIT is payable regardless of whether you otherwise pay any regular income tax or are subject to alternative minimum tax on your income. IRS regulations regarding the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) allow taxpayers to review their activity groupings beginning in the tax year in which they are first subject to this tax. Formerly, a taxpayer may have chosen groupings in order to maximize passive income (to offset passive losses). With the additional 3.8% tax imposed on passive trade or business income, taxpayers may desire a different grouping choice going forward. See The Importance of the Passive Activity Rules in chapter 49, Net Investment Income Tax for a detailed discussion. These rules are very complex and we recommend that you consult your tax advisor regarding your specific situation."
784,Chapter 12,Other income,Other Income,,EY,TAXPLANNER,"You should try to realign your personal finances so that you maximize your interest expense deductions. If you borrowed money to purchase a passive investment, any interest on the loan will be considered part of your passive investment loss. If you are in a real estate limited partnership, you may be able to have all the partners contribute additional capital so that the entity's passive loss is reduced or limited because the entity no longer has interest expense on the entity's loan. Your capital contribution could come from your other investments or from a mortgage on a personal residence. If you have untapped appreciation in your personal residence, you can borrow against it and deduct the interest cost subject to certain limitations. Make sure, however, that any mortgage does not exceed the limits applicable to your situation, because such disallowed interest would be considered nondeductible personal interest. Disposition of Passive Activity Previously disallowed losses (but not credits if you are in an overall loss position in the year of disposition) are recognized in full when the taxpayer disposes of his or her entire interest in the passive activity in a fully taxable transaction. However, suspended losses are not deductible when the taxpayer sells the interest to a related party. Rather, the losses remain with the individual (and may offset passive income) until the related purchaser disposes of the interest in a taxable transaction to an unrelated person. Various other types of dispositions trigger suspended losses, including abandonment, death of the taxpayer, gifts, and installment sales of entire interests, although special rules apply. A sale in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, reported on the installment method and included in income after December 31, 1986, would be considered income from a passive activity. Example Bob disposes of rental property in 1986 under the installment sale method and properly reports $2,000 of taxable gain in his 1987 through 2016 tax returns. Bob may treat the 1987 through 2016 gains as income from a passive activity and may offset other passive losses in these years. Tax Relief for Victims of Terrorism The following section discusses the tax treatment of certain amounts received by victims injured in a terrorist attack or survivors of victims killed as a result of a terrorist attack. Qualified disaster relief payments. Qualified disaster relief payments are not included in income. These payments are not subject to income tax, self-employment tax, or employment taxes (social security, Medicare, and federal unemployment taxes). No withholding applies to these payments. Qualified disaster relief payments include payments you receive (regardless of the source) for the following reasons: ·    Reasonable and necessary personal, family, living, or funeral expenses incurred as a result of a terrorist attack. ·    Reasonable and necessary expenses incurred for the repair or rehabilitation of a personal residence due to a terrorist attack. (A personal residence can be a rented residence or one you own.) ·    Reasonable and necessary expenses incurred for the repair or replacement of the contents of a personal residence due to a terrorist attack. ·    Qualified disaster relief payments also include the following: ·    Payments made by common carriers (for example, American Airlines and United Airlines regarding the September 11 attacks) because of death or physical injury incurred as a result of a terrorist attack. ·    Amounts received from a federal, state, or local government in connection with a terrorist attack by those affected by the attack. Disability payments. Disability payments received for injuries incurred as a direct result of a terrorist attack directed against the United States (or its allies), whether inside or outside of the United States, are not included in income. Payments to survivors of public safety officers. If you are the survivor of a public safety officer who died in the line of duty, the following types of payments are not included in your income: Bureau of Justice Assistance payments. If you are a surviving dependent of a public safety officer (law enforcement officer or firefighter) who died in the line of duty, do not include in your income the death benefit paid to you by the Bureau of Justice Assistance. Government plan annuity. If you receive a survivor annuity as the child or spouse (or former spouse) of a public safety officer who was killed in the line of duty, you generally do not have to include it in income. This exclusion applies to the amount of the annuity based upon the officer's service as a public safety officer. Public safety officer defined. A public safety officer, for the purpose of these exclusions, includes police and law enforcement officers, firefighters, and rescue squads and ambulance crews. More information.
